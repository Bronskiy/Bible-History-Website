#Isa 5:12; 14:11; Am 5:23; 6:5|

-SYMBOLS USED IN
-ALAMOTH
.(Literally virgins)
.A musical term which appears in
#1Ch 15:20|
.And in the title of
#Ps 46:1|
.(It seems to indicate the rendering of the song by female
voices, possibly soprano)
-AL-TASCHITH
.It appears in the titles of
#Ps 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 75:1|
.(it seems to have been used to indicate the kind of ode, or
the kind of melody in which the ode should be sung.)
-HIGGAION
#Ps 92:3|
.(According to Gesenius, it signifies the murmuring tone of a
harp, and hence that the music should be rendered in a
plaintive manner.)
#Ps 9:16|
.(Combined with ""Selah,"" it may have been intended to indicate
a pause in the vocal music while the instruments rendered an
interlude.)
#Ps 19:14|
.(Mendelssohn translates it ""meditation, thought."" Hence, the
music was to be rendered in a mode to promote devout
meditation.)
-MAKALATH, MASCHIL, LEANNOTH
.These terms are found in the titles of
#Ps 53:1; 88:1|
.(Authorities grope in darkness as to their signification.
They may indicate the instruments to be played, or the melody
to be sung)
-MASCHIL
.This musical sign occurs in the titles of
#Ps 32:1; 42:1; 44:1; 45:1; 52:1; 53:1; 54:1; 55:1; 74:1;
78:1; 88:1; 89:1; 142:1|
.(The meaning is obscure. But its signification where it
occurs elsewhere than in the titles of Psalms is equivalent
to the English word ""instruction,"" or to become wise by
instruction; hence, Ps 47:7: ""Sing ye praises with
understanding."")
-MICAHTAM
.A musical term in the titles of
#Ps 16:1; 56:1; 57:1; 58:1; 59:1; 60:1|
.(Luther interprets this as ""golden,"" that is, ""precious.""
Ewald interprets it as signifying a plaintive manner.)
-MUTH-LABBEN
.In the title of
#Ps 9:1|
.(Authorities, ancient and modern, differ as to the probable
signification. Gesenius and De Wette interpret it, ""with the
voice of virgins, by boys."" Others derive the word from a
different Hebrew root, and interpret it as indicating that
the Psalm was a funeral ode.)
-NEGINAH and NEGINOTH
.Appear in the titles of
#Ps 4:1; 54:1; 55:1; 61:1; 67:1; Hab 3:19|
.(Its use seems to have been to indicate that the song should
be accompanied by stringed instruments.)
-NEHILOTH
.Appears in the title of
#Ps 5:1|
.(It seems to indicate, according to Gesenius, that when this
Psalm was sung it was to be accompanied by wind instruments.)
-SELAH
.(This term appears frequently in the Psalms. Its use is not
known. Possibly it signified a pause in the vocal music
while an instrumental interlude or finale was rendered.)
-SHEMINITH
.In the titles of
#Ps 6:1; 12:1|
.(Translated ""eighth,"" probably indicates the measure,
movement, or pitch.)
-SHIGGAION
.In the title of
#Ps 7:1|
.And its plural, SHIGIONOTH, in the title of
#Hab 3:1|
.(Supposed to be a musical term to guide in rendering the
song. At the close of the chapter, the author refers the ode
""to the chief musician, on my stringed instruments."" The
term may suggest the movement in interpreting the music set
to it.)
-SHOSHANNIM and SHUSHAN-EDUTH
.In the titles to
#Ps 45:1; 60:1; 69:1; 80:1|
.(Seems to indicate the manner in which these Psalms were to
be rendered. Kimchi, Tremellius, and Eichhorn render it
""hexachorda,"" that is, that in singing these Psalms
instruments of six strings were to accompany.)
