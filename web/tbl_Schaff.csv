1,Aa'ron,"AA'RON (mountaineer, or more probably, from another root, enlightened),
   the first high priest of the Jews; eldest son of Amram, the grandson,
   and Jochebed, the daughter, of Levi; brother of Miriam, who was several
   years older, and of Moses, who was three years younger. Ex 6:20 ; cf.Ex
   2:1, Ex 6:4;Ex 7:7;Num 26:59. The family of Aaron belonged to the
   Kohathite branch of the tribe of Levi, the most numerous and powerful.
   This gave them prominence, so that the leadership naturally fell to
   them. When first mentioned he is called, Ex 4:14, the ""Levite,"" which
   implies that he was a recognized leader in his tribe, and, as the
   first-born son, he would be the priest of the household. Aaron's wife
   was Elisheba, daughter of the prince of Judah, and he had four sons,
   Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. Ex 6:23. The greater portion of his
   life is passed over in silence by the Bible writers, and he was
   eighty-three years old before he is introduced to us. Moses had timidly
   declined to be the leader of his people out of captivity, and had
   assigned as a reason that he was ""slow of speech and of a slow tongue,""
   Ex 4:10; whereupon God tells him that Aaron, his brother, was coming
   toward him, evidently under divine direction, and that he would act as
   his mouthpiece, because he possessed in a high degree popular gifts of
   speech and argument.

   Thus brought together, and understanding their respective functions,
   the brothers started for the court of Pharaoh, and from that time on
   Aaron played a very prominent part in the drama of Israel's
   deliverance. Side by side Moses and Aaron stand before the Lord, before
   Pharaoh, before the enraged elders of Israel. Furnished with words,
   Aaron utters them in these several presences, works miracles, and
   evinces courage. His work was by no means easy, but he carried it on
   successfully.

   On the way to Sinai the battle with Amalek was fought, and Aaron joins
   Hur in holding up the weary arms of Moses. Ex 17:9,Ex 17:13. With his
   two sons, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, he and
   Moses saw the Lord.Ex 24. But when Moses was not with him, then he
   showed himself weak, and it will always be told, to his discredit, that
   he made the golden calf -- not, indeed, as a substitute for Jehovah,
   but rather as a concession. He proclaimed a feast to the Lord, but the
   people ran into great excesses, and as Moses was descending from the
   mount it was the noise of the dancing and music which so raised his
   anger. Ex 32. Notwithstanding this grievous sin Aaron and his sons were
   consecrated as the first priests of the Israelites. Ex 40:12-15; cf. Ex
   28; Lev 8.

   See Priest. He was forbidden to mourn for his sons, Nadab and Abihu,
   who were destroyed for offering strange fire. Lev 10. Miriam, becoming
   jealous of Moses' wife, probably because her influence was weakened,
   induced Aaron to murmur against Moses on the ground that he assumed too
   much authority. Aaron deeply repented when rebuked, and joined with
   Moses in a prayer for Miriam's recovery. Num 12. See Miriam. Twenty
   years later the Lord interposed to vindicate Aaron's authority against
   Korah and his company, and by a miracle, the budding rod, confirmed the
   original choice. Num 16, Num 17. The plague which broke out was stopped
   by Aaron's atonement. He stood between the living and the dead.

   Aaron fell under the influence of whichever strong nature was nearest
   to his at the time. So he was carried away by Moses into sin at the
   waters of Meribah, and in punishment they were both kept out of the
   Promised Land. Aaron died first, upon Mount Hor, from whence he could
   obtain a distant view of Palestine, and there, in the presence of
   Moses, who stripped him of his priestly garments and put them upon
   Aaron's son, Eleazar, the first high priest, who for nearly forty years
   had discharged his sacred office, in spite of his faults thus highly
   exalted, fell, at the age of one hundred and twenty-three, under the
   dominion of the universal conqueror, and was buried upon the mountain.
   Num 20:23-29. A Mohammedan mosque marks the supposed grave of Aaron, on
   one of the two tops of Mount Hor, which is near Petra, in the desert.
   See Hor, Mount.

   Aaron is called the ""saint of the Lord "" with reference to his official
   character, Ps 106:16, but, as the most superficial study of his life
   shows, he was far from perfect. He was a better servant than master. He
   was weak in command, but faithful in duty. He yielded like wax to the
   impressions of the moment. Yet it may readily be believed that the
   people loved him, perhaps more than Moses, and that the mourning over
   his death, which lasted thirty days, Num 20:28, was sincere. One of the
   fasts of later Judaism was one in his memory, held on the first day of
   the fifth month, Ab, our July or August.

   The Jewish priesthood began in the family of Aaron and remained its
   possession, though not uninterruptedly, in the line of Eleazar; it
   passed into the family of Ithamar, the brother of Eleazar, in the
   person of Eli; but, in consequence of the excesses of Eli's sons, God
   declared that it should be taken from his family, 1 Sam 2:30, and this
   prophecy was fulfilled in the time of Solomon, who took the priesthood
   from Abiathar and restored it to Zadok, of the line of Eleazar. 1 Kgs

   rises in the mountains of Anti-Libanus, about 23 miles N. W. of
   Damascus, runs through the city in several streams or canals, thence
   across the plain, and 18 miles east of Damascus falls by several
   branches into the marshy Bahret-el Kihliyeh, or so-called ""Meadow

   king of Babylon to Azariah, one of the four youths mentioned in the
   book of Daniel who were taken captive at Jerusalem, b. c. 604, and
   carried to Babylon, where they were trained for the royal service. Dan

15,A'bel,"A'BEL( Heb. Hebel--i. e. breath, vapor), the second son of Adam and

   because, since Cain was not the promised seed, as Eve expected at his
   birth, life itself seemed of little worth; it was but ""a vapour, that
   appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away."" Gen 4:2. He was
   a keeper or feeder of sheep, and in process of time brought of the
   firstlings or first-fruits of his flock an offering unto the Lord. God
   accepted his offering and gave him evidence of it. Heb 11:4. Not so
   with Cain. Either his sacrifice, or the manner of presenting it,

28,Abi athar,"ABI'ATHAR (father of abundance, i. e. liberal), the tenth high priest
   of the Jews, and fourth in descent from Eli. 1 Sam 22:20. He was the
   son of Ahimelech, and the only one who escaped when Doeg at Saul's
   command slew the priests at Nob in revenge for Ahimelech's service to
   David in inquiring of the Lord for him, and in giving him the
   shew-bread to eat, and Goliath's sword.1 Sam 22. Abiathar fled to David
   at Keilah, and told him what Saul had done. David received him, and he
   afterward became high priest. Thus there were two high priests in
   Israel at the same time -- Abiathar, in the party of David, and Zadok,
   in the party of Saul, 2 Sam 8:17; but, in consequence of his supporting
   Adonijah in his pretensions to the throne of David, Solomon, upon
   becoming king, thrust Abiathar out of the priesthood, 1 Kgs 2:27, and
   conferred the office exclusively upon Zadok. See Zadok. Thus was
   fulfilled the word of God to Eli, 1 Sam 2:31; for Abiathar was the last
   of the priests of the house of Ithamar, to which Eli belonged; and
   Zadok, who succeeded him, was of the family of Eleazar; and so the
   priesthood passed into its former channel. Abiathar, mentioned in Mark
   2:26, has been supposed by some to be the same with Ahimelech. The most
   probable solution of the difficulty is, perhaps, that Abiathar and
   Ahimelech may have been hereditary names in the family, and therefore
   were both borne by the same person. Hence the name Abiathar, being that
   of David's friend, would be more commonly used than Ahimelech. This
   theory also accounts for the substitution of one name for another in 2
   Sam 8:17; 1 Chr 18:16, and 1 Chr 24:3, 1 Chr 24:6, 1 Chr 24:31. The

   rude and contemptuous treatment of his messengers, Abigail hastened to

   of the ten tribes, and defeated him, with a loss of 500,000 men. These
   figures are probably through a mistake made too large; the loss, it is
   likely, was not greater than 50,000. He began to reign in the 18th year
   of Jeroboam, and was succeeded by his son Asa in the 20th year of
   Jeroboam, so that he reigned only a part of three years. The apparent
   contradiction in respect to the parentage of this person, as it is
   given in 1 Kgs 15:2 and 2 Chr 13:2 may be explained by supposing that
   his mother Maachah (or Michaiah) was the daughter of Uriel and the

   first hear of him, particularly, as the captain of the host, of whom
   Saul inquired concerning the stripling, David, whose victory over
   Goliath had excited his astonishment; and after a little time Abner
   introduced David to Saul, with the head of the giant Philistine in his
   hand. 1 Sam 17:57. It was through the want of vigilance in Abner that
   Saul's life was placed in David's power in the wilderness of Ziph. 1
   Sam 26. See David, Saul. After David was anointed king of Judah, Abner
   procured the appointment of Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, as king of Israel;
   and in process of time the army of David, under Joab, and the army of
   Israel, under Abner, arrayed themselves on either side of the pool of
   Gibeon. While occupying this position twelve men of each army met and
   fought desperately. This contest was followed by a general battle,
   which resulted in Abner's defeat. He fled, but was pursued by Asahel,
   who ""was light of foot as a wild roe.""","",1
57,Abo,"When in the heat of pursuit, Abner counselled him to desist, and
   threatened to turn upon him and slay him if he did not, but Asahel
   refused to turn aside, and Abner, '' with the hinder end of the spear,""
   smote him so that he died. Joab and Abishai were also engaged in the
   pursuit, but at Abner's entreaty they desisted and returned. 2 Sam 2.

   As David's strength increased, the house of Saul, though faithfully
   served by Abner, became gradually weaker, till at length Ish-bosheth
   charged Abner with an offence against Saul's family. 2 Sam 3:7. He had
   taken Rizpah, the concubine of Saul, into his harem, and this act was
   interpreted according to Oriental ideas as an attempt to seize the
   throne. He was exceedingly irritated by the charge, and immediately
   forsook the interests of Saul's house and espoused the cause of David.
   David received him cordially, and sent him away in peace to persuade
   Israel to submit to David's government.

   While he was gone on this errand, Joab returned ; and hearing what had
   been done, he went to the king and warned him against Abner as a spy
   and traitor. Soon after, and without David's knowledge, Joab sent for
   Abner ; and when he arrived, took him aside privately, and murdered him
   in revenge of the death of his brother Asahel ; and they buried him in
   Hebron. The estimation in which he was held by the king and people
   appears from the sacred history. The king wept and refused his food,
   and all the people wept; ""And the king said unto his servants. Know ye
   not that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel ?""

   a thing hateful or detestable, as the employment or calling of

    1. Under the Mosaic law those animals and acts are called abominable
       the use or doing of which was prohibited. Lev 11:13 and Deut 23:18.

   these idolatrous standards should be seen "" in the holy place,"" or,
   more strictly, in the vicinity of the holy city, thus threatening a
   complete conquest and speedy destruction, it would be time for the men
   of Judea to flee to places of refuge to save themselves from
   tribulation and death. The words are hard to interpret. To the
   explanation given it is objected that unless the standards were
   worshipped they would not properly be "" abominations."" Others say the
   words refer to the ""internal desecration of the temple by the Jewish
   zealots, under pretence of defending it.""","",1

   not have been lost. Abram would seem always to have been the consistent
   servant of the one God. While he was dwelling in his father's house at
   Ur, God directed him to leave his country and kindred and go to a land
   which should be shown him; promising, at the same time, to make of him
   a great nation, and to bless him, and to make his name great, and that
   in him all the families of the earth should be blessed.

   Obedient to the heavenly calling, Abram took Sarai his wife, and, with
   Terah his father and other members of the family, left Ur to remove to
   Canaan, and stopped at Haran in Mesopotamia. There Terah died. Abram,
   who was then seventy-five years old, with his wife and Lot, his nephew,
   pursued his journey to Canaan; and having reached Shechem, one of the
   oldest cities of Palestine (see Shechem), the Lord appeared to him, and
   repeated his promise to give him the land. Gen 12:7.

   A grievous famine soon visited the country, and Abram was obliged to go
   into Egypt. Fearful that Sarai's beauty might attract the notice of the
   Egyptians, and that, if they supposed her to be his wife they would
   kill him to secure her, he proposed that she should pass for his
   sister. It happened as he expected. The servants of Pharaoh, the king
   of Egypt, commended her beauty so much that he sent for her, and took
   her into his house, and loaded Abram with tokens of his favor; but the
   Lord punished him (Pharaoh) severely, so that he sent away Abram and
   his wife, and all that he had. His stay in Egypt was probably very
   brief.

   Having become very rich in cattle, silver, and gold, he returned from
   Egypt to Canaan, and encamped between Bethel and Ai, in Southern
   Palestine. Lot, his nephew, had been with him, and shared his
   prosperity ; and it happened that his servants fell into some strife
   with the servants of Abram. Their property being too great for them to
   dwell together, Abram generously proposed to his nephew to avoid
   controversy by an amicable separation. He offered Lot his choice of the
   territory, on the right or left, as it pleased him -- a rare
   illustration of meekness and condescension. Lot chose to remove to the
   eastward, and occupy that part of the fertile plain of Jordan where
   Sodom and Gomorrah stood, having, perhaps, a desire to quit the
   wandering life.

   Then the Lord appeared again to Abram, and renewed the promise of the
   land of Canaan as his inheritance in the most explicit manner. He
   thence removed his tent to the oak-groves of Mamre in Hebron. In an
   invasion of the cities of the plain by several of the petty kings of
   the adjoining provinces, under the leadership of Chedorlaomer, king of
   Elam, Sodom was taken and Lot and his family carried captive. When
   Abram received intelligence of it he armed his trained servants, born
   in his house (three hundred and eighteen in number), defeated the
   kings, and brought Lot and his family back to Sodom ; restoring to
   liberty the captives who had been taken, with all their property, of
   which he generously refused to take any part as the reward of his
   services or as the spoils of victory. On his return he was met by
   Melchisedek, king of Salem and priest of the most high God, to whom he
   gave a tenth of all that he had. Gen 14. See MELCHISEDEK.

   While in Hebron the Lord appeared again to Abram in a vision, repeated
   to him the promises, and accompanied them with the gracious declaration
   of his favor. He appointed a certain sacrifice for him to offer, and
   toward night caused a deep sleep to fall upon him, attended by a horror
   of great darkness, during which there were revealed to him some of the
   most important events in his future history and in that of his
   posterity, which were all accomplished in due time and with wonderful
   exactness. The revelation related -- 1. To the captivity of Israel by
   the Egyptians and their severe and protracted bondage ; 2. To the
   judgments which Egypt should suffer because of their oppression of
   God's chosen people, and the circumstances under which they should
   leave Egypt; 3. To Abram's death and burial; and, 4, to the return of
   his posterity to the promised land.

   In the same day the covenant respecting the land of promise was renewed
   and confirmed with the strongest expressions of divine favor. Sarai,
   however, was childless, and she proposed to Abraham that Hagar, an
   Egyptian woman living


   with them, should be his concubine ; by whom he had a son, called
   Ishmael. He was then in his eighty-sixth year. Gen 16.

   At ninety-nine years of age he was favored with another remarkable
   vision. The Almighty was revealed to him in such a manner that he was
   filled with awe and fell upon his face, and we are told that ""God
   talked with him."" The promise respecting the great increase of his
   posterity and the possession of Canaan was repeated in the most solemn
   and explicit terms; his name was changed from Abram (a high father) to
   Abraham (father of a great multitude), and the circumcision of every
   male child at eight days old was established as a token of the covenant
   between him and God. See CIRCUMCISION. At the same time the name of
   Sarai (my princess) was changed to Sarah (the princess), and a promise
   was given to Abraham that Sarah should have a son and be the mother of
   nations and kings.

   It seemed so entirely out of the course of nature that they should
   become parents at their advanced age that Abraham, filled with
   reverence and joyful gratitude, fell upon his face ""and said in his
   heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old? and
   shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"" Nevertheless, against
   hope he believed in hope; and being not weak in faith, he staggered not
   at the promise of God, but was fully persuaded that what he had
   promised he was able also to perform; and his faith was imputed to him
   for righteousness. Rom 4:18-22.

   Abraham, finding that the blessings of the covenant were to be bestowed
   on his future offspring, immediately thought of Ishmael, in whom he had
   probably before supposed the promises were to be fulfilled, and he
   uttered the solemn and affecting prayer, ""O that Ishmael might live
   before thee!"" God heard him, and almost while he was yet speaking
   answered him by making known to him his great purposes respecting
   Ishmael. Gen 17:20 and Gen 25:16.

   As soon as the vision had closed, Abraham hastened to obey the divine
   command, and with Ishmael, his son, and all the men of his house, was
   circumcised in the self-same day. He was not long without another
   divine communication. As he sat in the door of his tent in the heat of
   the day three men approached him. He received them with all the
   courtesy and hospitality customary in the East, and after they had
   refreshed themselves they inquired of him respecting Sarah and repeated
   the promise respecting the birth of her son.

   It was on this occasion, or in connection with these circumstances,
   that a divine testimony was given to the patriarchal character of
   Abraham. Gen 18:19. It was because of his faithfulness that he was
   favored with a revelation of God's purposes respecting the devoted
   cities of the plain, and with an opportunity to plead for them; and it
   was for Abraham's sake, and probably in answer to his prayers, that Lot
   and his family were rescued from the sudden destruction which came upon
   Sodom.

   After this, Abraham removed to Gerar, perhaps because the Amorites,
   with whom he was in alliance, had been driven from Hebron by the
   Hittites. Here he made a second attempt to have Sarah taken for his
   sister. See ABIMELECH. Here, also, the prediction was fulfilled
   respecting the birth of a son. Sarah had a son, whom he called Isaac,
   and who was duly circumcised on the eighth day.

   When Isaac was weaned, Abraham made a feast. Ishmael, being then a lad
   of thirteen years, mocked Isaac, quite possibly without malicious
   intent. This roused the jealousy of Sarah, who urged Abraham to drive
   out Hagar and her son. Abraham, although unwilling to do this
   injustice, at last obeyed at the command of God. Thus it came to pass
   that the prophecy of the wild life Ishmael was to lead was realized.Gen
   21:10-13.

   Abraham so obviously enjoyed the favor and blessing of God in all that
   he did that Abimelech, the king, proposed to make with him a covenant
   of perpetual friendship; and a matter of wrong about a well, of which
   Abimelech's servants had violently deprived Abraham, was thus happily
   adjusted. This transaction was at a place which was there after called
   Beer-sheba (the well of the oath, or the well of swearing). Gen
   21:23-31.","",1
60,Abs,"ABS
   The events of many years are now passed over in silence, but the scene
   next related shows how worthy Abraham was to be called the father of
   the faithful. He was commanded to take his son, his only son, Isaac,
   then a young man, and to offer him up for a burnt-offering upon a
   distant mountain. Without an inquiry or murmuring word, and with a
   prompt submission, Abraham obeyed the command. A journey of three days
   was accomplished. Every preparation for the offering was made, and the
   knife was uplifted to slay his son, when his purpose was arrested by a
   voice from Heaven requiring him to spare the lad. A ram was provided in
   the neighboring thicket, which he took and offered up ; and, after
   having been favored with special tokens of the divine approbation, he
   returned with his son to Beer-sheba. This grand trial and proof of the
   patriarch's faith took place upon Mount Moriah (or, as others suppose,
   on Mount Gerizim). In commemoration of it he gave to the place the name
   Jehovah-jireh {the Lord will provide), intimating a general truth
   respecting the divine faithfulness and care, and in prophetical
   allusion to the great sacrifice which was to be offered for the sins of
   mankind. Gen 22:14.

   At the age of one hundred and twenty-seven years Sarah died, and
   Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron at
   Hebron, for a family burial-place, and there buried his wife. Gen
   23:19, Gen 23:20,

   Isaac had now arrived at mature age, and Abraham called one of his
   servants, probably Eliezer, Gen 15:2, and made him promise to obtain a
   wife for Isaac, not among the Canaanites, but in Abraham's native
   country and from among his own kindred. This enterprise terminated
   successfully, and every desire of the patriarch respecting Isaac's
   marriage was answered. Gen 24.

   Abraham married a second time and had several sons, but he made Isaac
   his sole heir, having in his lifetime distributed gifts among the other
   children, who were now dispersed. He died in peace at the age of one
   hundred and seventy five years, and was buried by Isaac and Ishmael in
   the same sepulchre with Sarah, in the cave of Machpelah. Gen 25:8.

   AB'SALOM (father of peace) was the third son of David by Maacah,
   daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur. 2 Sam 3:3. He was remarkable for
   his beauty, and for his hair, which is said to have weighed 200 shekels
   when cut off every year. But if the royal shekel equal the sacred
   shekel, this would make 6 pounds, which is incredible. The difficulty
   is not removed by reducing the value of the shekel one-half or
   one-third.

   19

   The simplest explanation is that by the error of a copyist the 200 was
   written for 20, the difference between the figures being very slight in
   Hebrew notation.

   Absalom's fair sister, called Tamar, having been violated by Amnon, his
   half-brother, he meditated revenge, since he was her natural avenger;
   and after brooding over the outrage for two years, he at last took
   Amnon's life at a feast to which he had invited him, and then at once
   fled to Talmai, his maternal grandfather, at Geshur, where he stayed
   three years.

   Joab, in order to secure Absalom's return and restoration to his
   father's favor, employed a woman of Tekoa to appear before David and
   feign a case similar to the situation of Absalom, and having obtained
   his decision, to apply the principle to the real case. After a
   favorable decision was obtained in the feigned case, the woman began to
   plead for Absalom's return. The king suspected Joab's concern in the
   plot, and the woman confessed that it was wholly planned by him. David,
   however, directed Joab to go to Geshur and bring Absalom back to
   Jerusalem, but would not receive him into favor nor admit him to his
   presence, nor did he see his face for two years more.

   Wearied with his banishment, Absalom often attempted to obtain an
   interview with Joab, but for some cause Joab was not disposed to go to
   him. To compel him to come, Absalom resorted to a singular expedient;
   he directed his servants to set fire to Joab's fields. Joab immediately
   came to Absalom, was persuaded to plead with the king in his behalf,
   succeeded in his effort, and Absalom was received into full favor.

   Absalom then showed the object of his ambition was to obtain his
   father's throne. He was jealous of the favor his father gave to
   Solomon, Bath-sheba's son, for, since he was the oldest living son of
   David, he was by birth the rightful heir to the kingdom. To this end he
   lived in great pomp, procured chariots and horsemen and other
   appendages of royalty, and stood in the public places courting the
   favor of the people by the meanest arts, persuading them that their
   rights were not regarded by the government, and that it would be for
   their interest to elevate him to power, that equal justice might be
   administered to all. By these and other means Absalom stole the hearts
   of the men of Israel.

   In pursuing his traitorous design, and with a pretended regard to
   filial duty, he asked his father's permission to go to Hebron and pay a
   vow which he said he had made. The unsuspicious king consented, and
   Absalom immediately sent men throughout Israel, who were, at a given
   signal, to proclaim him king in Hebron. He also took two hundred men
   with him from Jerusalem, though they did not know his plan, and then
   sent for Ahithophel, who was David's counsellor, that he might have his
   advice and assistance. Absalom's party increased rapidly, and
   intelligence of the conspiracy was communicated to the king, and so
   alarmed him that he fled from the city.

   At length David persuaded Hushai to go to Absalom, who had now come
   back to Jerusalem with his party, and become his servant, and when
   opportunity occurred to give such counsel as should defeat Ahithophel's
   plans and bring confusion and discomfiture upon Absalom. By a train of
   providential interpositions Absalom's ruin was hastened.

   Before David's men went out to battle with the revolted party, he gave
   them special charge respecting Absalom, and commanded them to deal
   gently with him for his father's sake. The two parties met in the wood
   of Ephraim, and the battle was bloody. Absalom rode upon a mule, and in
   passing under the thick boughs of an oak he was caught by his head in
   the fork or angle of two branches, and the mule passed onward, leaving
   him suspended in the air. Joab, one of David's chief captains, being
   informed of it, took three darts and thrust them through the heart of
   Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak; and they took
   his body and cast it into a pit in the wood, and covered it with
   stones.

   supposed to have been compiled by Luke the evangelist in Rome, during
   Paul's imprisonment or shortly after, a.d. 63, and may be regarded as a
   continuation of his Gospel. It contains the history of the Christian
   Church from Jerusalem to Rome, or the establishment of Christianity
   among the Jews by Peter, and among the Gentiles by Paul. It begins with
   the ascension of Christ and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and
   concludes with the first imprisonment of Paul in Rome, 61 to 63. It is
   the first history of the Christian Church, and contains the only
   trustworthy account of the missionary labors of the apostles.

   The book of Acts has been subjected to very rigid and critical
   examination in connection with the apostolic Epistles, and the
   genuineness of both is proved by coincidences so minute and yet so
   undesigned, so obvious and yet so remote, that no unprejudiced mind can
   entertain a doubt of their truthfulness.

   It has been located at ed-Damieh, but Drake suggests Khurbet-el-

(red, or earth-born). The word is used in the Bible in two senses
   : 1. Man generically, including woman (in the English Version
   translated man). Gen 1:26, Gen 1:27 ; Jud 5:1; Gen 6:1; Job 20:29: Job
   21:33; Ps 68:18;Ps 76:10.
    1. Man historically, or, as a proper name, Adam individually, the
       first man, who was at the same time the representative man. Gen
       2:7; Gen 3:8. Adam was not born, but created ; not in feeble,
       helpless infancy, but in the maturity of his physical and
       intellectual nature ; not a sinful, diseased, dying creature, but
       pure and free from sin, yet liable to temptation and in need of
       trial in order to be confirmed in his innocence. He was the crown
       of creation, made on the sixth day, after the vegetable and animal
       world. Adam was the root of hu

   manity, and all that affected him affected his posterity. His sin
   tainted their blood and poisoned their nature; while the Saviour
   promised to him was the Saviour of all who came after him. His
   mortality in consequence of sin has remained as a permanent fact in
   man; his immortality in consequence of faith upon the promised Saviour
   will be shared in by all of like belief. In him God put humanity to the
   test. If Adam had kept his first estate, the world would never have
   been darkened by sin and guilt.

   Adam was also the beginning of a new order of beings. He was of the
   earth, earthy -- the earth is called ada mah in Hebrew in Gen 2:7 --
   dust from dust, as to his physical organization, but into him God had
   breathed a living soul; he was an immortal spirit, made in the very
   ""image and likeness of God."" This is the noblest conception of man. The
   ""image of God"" means man's personality, his rational, moral, and
   immortal nature, which is destined for the glory and communion of God
   and for everlasting felicity. It also includes dominion over the
   creatures.

   God created Eve to be a help meet for Adam. He dreamt of woman, and
   awaked to find her at his side. The pair lived together in happiness
   and innocence, the keepers of a garden which yielded abundantly of
   fruit and flowers for their nourishment and pleasure. The fruit of one
   tree only, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was forbidden to
   them. But the prohibition piqued their desire. Eve listened to the
   specious arguments of Satan, who had come to her under the form of a
   serpent; ""she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
   unto her husband with her; and he did eat."" Gen 3:6; comp. 2 Cor 11:3 ;
   1 Tim 2:14 ; John 8:44.

   In this simple language does the Bible describe the most momentous
   event in history previous to the birth of Christ. For then happened the
   Fall; sin was let loose to ravage the world; a blight had fallen upon
   the race. The first proof of sin was shame. The wretched folly of all
   attempts to cover sin is symbolized by the fig-leaf aprons of our first
   parents; they were no coverings at all. The second proof of sin was
   their fear before God. They stood condemned, and owned his dreadful
   sentence just. They were banished from Paradise. The ground was cursed
   for their sake. In the hardship of toil and labor, in the care and
   suffering of childbirth and parentage, they began to feel at once the
   woes their transgression involved. All the burdens of life, the heavy
   cross, sickness, disaster, trouble, death, come from the action of that
   fatal day. They are the dread reminders of our fallen state. Our first
   parents involved all their posterity in that ruin they first
   experienced.

   But in the narrative of the Fall there stands also the promise of a
   deliverer, the woman's seed (the son of Mary), who should crush the
   serpent's head--that is, destroy the power of sin and Satan. Gen 3:15.
   This promise, which is called the ""first gospel,"" was fulfilled in the
   Crucifixion. Christ is the second Adam, as Paul shows in Rom 5:12 ff.
   and 1 Cor 15:45. He undid the work of the first. He abolished the power
   of sin and death for believers, and brought life and immortality to
   light through the gospel. 2 Tim 1:10. The redemption by Christ is the
   glorious solution of the fall of Adam. Christ has given us much more
   than we lost by Adam. Paradise regained is better than Paradise lost,
   and can never be lost again. God in his infinite wisdom and mercy
   overruled the fall of man for the revelation of his redeeming love,
   which in turn calls out the deepest gratitude and bliss of the
   redeemed.

   not always mean what the English word denotes. 1. In Gen 49:17 it
   indicates a venomous serpent (perhaps the cerastes, or horned snake)
   which lurks in the path. The usual habit of the cerastes is ""to coil
   itself on the sand, where it basks in the impress of a camel's
   footmark, and thence suddenly to dart out on any passing animal. So
   great is the terror which its sight inspires in horses, that I have
   known mine, when I was riding in the Sahara, to suddenly start and
   rear, trembling and perspiring in every limb, and no persuasions would
   induce him to proceed. I was quite unable to account for his terror
   until I noticed a cerastes coiled up in a depression two or three paces
   in front, with its basilisk eyes steadily fixed on us, and no doubt
   preparing for a spring as the horse passed."" -- Tristram.

    1. In Ps 58:4 and Ps 91:13 the Egyptian cobra is probably meant, for

       Egyptian monuments, symbolizing immortality, and always connected
       with the winged globe. In the former passage above, there is

109,Adonijah,"ADONI'JAH (my Lord is Jehovah). 1. David's fourth son. 2 Sam 3:4. He
   was born at Hebron, and after the death of his brothers, Amnon,
   Chileab, and Absalom, he made pretensions to the throne of his father,
   because he was then the oldest living son of David. He prepared himself
   with horses and chariots and other marks of royalty, and took counsel
   with Joab and Abiathar how he could best accomplish his purpose.
   Bath-sheba, Solomon's mother, fearing that her son's title to the
   throne might be disturbed, immediately informed the king of Adonijah's
   revolt; and Nathan the prophet having confirmed the statement of the
   matter, David gave Bath-sheba the strongest assurances that her son
   should reign after him; and he caused Solomon to be anointed and
   proclaimed king amid general rejoicings. 1 Kgs 1:39.

   Adonijah was just ending a feast when he heard the noise of the
   shouting, and Jonathan came in and told him all that had taken place.
   His guests fled precipitately, and Adonijah himself ran and caught hold
   of the horns of the altar, which from long-existent custom was regarded
   as a place of safety. But Solomon sent for him, and pardoned him on
   condition that he showed himself ""a worthy man."" 1 Kgs 1:52. This was
   an act of rare clemency.

   After David's death, Adonijah persuaded Bath-sheba to ask Solomon, her
   son, who was now on the throne, to give him Abishag for his wife. This
   request was, according to Oriental court-etiquette, equivalent to a
   fresh attempt on the throne. So Solomon caused him to be put to death

111,Adoni-zedek,"ADON'I-ZE'DEK (lord of justice), the Amorite king of Jerusalem at the
   time the country was entered by the Israelites. Josh 10:1. The name was
   probably the official title of the Jebusite kings of Jerusalem. Hearing
   of Joshua's victories over Ai and Jericho, and finding that the
   inhabitants of Gibeon, one of the most important cities of the kingdom,
   had made a league with him, he called four other kings of the Ammonites
   to his aid and laid siege to Gibeon, with a view to destroy it as a
   punishment for their conduct.

   But Joshua came to the assistance of the Gibeonites; hailstones fell
   upon the armies of the five kings, and after a hard battle they were
   overthrown. See Joshua.

   Adoni-zedek, with his allies, fled to a cave at Makkedah, in which they
   were soon discovered and brought before Joshua, who caused them to be
   slain and hanged on separate trees until evening, and then their bodies
   were taken down and cast into the cave in which they had concealed
   themselves. Josh 10:27.","",1
112,Adoption,"ADOP'TION is an act by which a stranger is received into a man's family

   was adopted by Pharaoh's daughter, Ex 2:10, and Esther by her cousin
   Mordecai. Esth 2:7.

   In the figurative use of the term by the sacred writers it indicates
   that intimate relation of the believer to God which follows
   regeneration and conversion from sin to holiness, when we are received
   into the family of God and are made, by grace, his children or sons,

       who was stoned to death by the people of Israel who followed

       Adoniram, 1 Kgs 5:14, who was over the customs in Solomon's reign,
       and that the people were so indignant at the oppression they had
       suffered through his agency that they took this method of revenge.","",1
114,Adoration,"ADORA'TION. The word means to pray to, and is properly applied to the
   worship of God. Among the Hebrews adoration by outward act was
   variously performed. We gather from different Scripture passages that
   it consisted in putting off the shoes, bowing the knee or the head, or
   in slowly prostrating the body by first falling on the knees and then
   bending the body until the head touched the ground. But these forms of
   adoration were not limited to the worship of Jehovah. The Eastern mode
   of salutation is very obsequious, and so between an inferior and a
   superior the same ceremonies would be performed, and also between
   equals. Similar was their conduct in the worship of idols when seeking
   the good-will of one whom they had offended. Kissing the hand of an
   idol was a common mode of adoration. These acts were often repeated
   more than once. In the New Testament we read that our Lord was treated
   with these outward signs of respect and reverence. So, too, in the case
   of Peter, to whom Cornelius prostrated himself. See Worship.","",1

   Chron 11:15. Tradition has located it in Wady Khureitun, east of
   Bethlehem. The cave is said to be well fitted for a robbers' hold,
   being dry and airy and full of intricate passages. The greatest length
   of this cave is 550 feet. Lieut. Conder, however, places the cave of
   Adullam in the valley of Elah, not far from the city of Adullam, about
   13 miles west from Bethlehem. Near it are numerous caverns, each as
   large as an ordinary cottage, which would give room for David and his
   band. He states that the great caverns at Beit Jibrin, which some have
   regarded as the cave of Adullam, are damp, cold, and full of bats and
   creeping things, and carefully avoided by the cave-dwelling peasants,
   while the smaller caves north and west of Adullam are almost constantly
   in use, and are from their position strong and defensible. A row of
   these caves has been found north and west of the city of Adullam
   capable of holding 200 to 300 men. M. Ganneau first suggested this
   location in 1872, from the resemblance of the modern name Aid el-Ma,

121,Adultery,"ADUL'TERY, the crime forbidden in the seventh commandment. According to
   Jewish law, it is the unlawful intercourse of a man, whether married or
   not, with a married or betrothed woman not his wife. The crime was
   punished in patriarchal times, if Tamar's be a specimen case, by
   burning.Gen 38:24, or at least capitally. Under the Mosaic law in the
   case of the free woman both offenders were stoned. But a bondwoman thus
   guilty was to be scourged, and the man must make a trespass-offering.
   Lev 19:20,Lev 19:22. The so called ""water of jealousy,"" by which the
   guilt of the accused woman was proven or refuted, was simply some ""
   holy water,"" or that from the laver which stood near the altar in an
   earthen vessel, into which dust from the floor of the tabernacle was
   sprinkled. This mixture was given to the woman, who was solemnly
   charged by the priest with an oath of cursing. If she was guilty, then
   by divine interposition -- for it contained nothing injurious -- this
   test proved her guilt. If innocent no effect was produced. The accuser
   in these cases was the husband. Num 5:11-31. There is no case of the
   use of this test in Scripture. Adultery is the only ground of divorce
   recognized by our Lord. Matt 5:32.

   Adultery is used in the Bible in a spiritual sense to denote the
   unfaithfulness and apostasy of the Jews, because the union between God

   some to be derived from the river Achates, in Sicily, where the stone
   was formerly found in great abundance. The agate of Isa 54:12 and Eze

   AG'RICULTURE. In its special sense, and as here employed, the term
   denotes the cultivation of grain and other field crops. In a broader
   meaning, the threefold business of many agriculturists includes,
   besides such cultivation, the keeping of flocks and herds, and
   horticulture.

   History. -- To dress and keep the garden of Eden was the happy
   employment given to man at his creation. After the Fall, Adam was
   driven forth to till the ground as the first farmer. This was also the
   employment of Cain, but Abel was a keeper of sheep. After the Flood,
   ""Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard."" The
   patriarchs and their descendants, till their settlement in Palestine,
   gave little attention to agriculture. Joseph's words comprehensively
   describe their occupation; ""The men are shepherds, for their trade hath
   been to feed cattle."" With the possession of the cultivated lands of
   the Canaanites, the Hebrews adopted a more strictly agricultural life,
   and, in general, the methods of farming of those whom they conquered.
   Pastoral employments were, however, never wholly abandoned. The tribes
   east of the Jordan were possessed of ""a very great multitude of
   cattle,"" and in Judaea and all the more hilly districts shepherds
   always abounded.

   Soil. -- Palestine is divided agriculturally, and as to all its
   physical conditions, into four districts : 1. The maritime plains,
   including the rich coast lands of Gaza, Sharon, etc., with a mild and
   equable climate, under which even the orange and banana flourish. 2.
   The valley of the Jordan, reaching from the waters of Merom to the
   southern end of the Dead Sea, having a tropical temperature. 3. The
   hill-country between these divisions eastward of Carmel, bisected by
   the rich plain of Jezreel, and bosoming many fertile vales, such as
   those of Nazareth, Shechem, Samaria, Hebron, but often rising,
   especially southward, into bleak moors and highlands, where snow
   sometimes falls in winter. 4. Peræa, the rolling and often mountainous
   plateau east of the Jordan valley, not very different in climate from
   the last division, but in soil more fertile. In this last region Dr.
   Merrill reports the tillable area of the Hauran (ancient Bashan) to be
   150 by 40 miles in extent, and one vast natural wheat-field. Here he
   has ""seen a peasant plough a furrow as straight as a line, one and even
   two miles long."" In Argob and Trachonitis he saw one of the largest
   lava-beds in the world, covering 400 or 500 square miles, and the
   source of inexhaustible fertility. Of Palestine west of the Jordan,
   which is less in extent than the State of Vermont, Captain Warren says:
   ""The soil is so rich, the climate so varied, that within ordinary
   limits it may be said that the more people it contained the more it
   may. Its productiveness will increase in proportion to the labor
   bestowed on the soil, until a population of fifteen millions may be
   accommodated there."" By others we are told that the very sand of the
   shore is fertile if watered. The soil of Palestine is enriched by the
   disintegration of the rocks, which are commonly limestone, often quite
   chalky.

   Seasons. -- Of these there are practically but two -- the rainy and the
   dry -- nearly divided from each other by the vernal and autumnal
   equinoxes. The showers begin to fall in November, at the latest, and
   the rains of the winter months, except it be February, are heavy. These
   are ""the former rain"" of Scripture, which rarely fails, while ""the
   latter rain"" of March and early April is more uncertain; and as the
   filling of the ears of grain depends upon it, this ""latter rain"" is
   eagerly expected. Job 29:23 ; Zech 10:1. Storms in Palestine are
   ordinarily brought by the west or south-west wind. 1 Kgs 18:44; Luke
   12:54.

   Without question, this country was in Bible times better supplied with
   forests and orchards than now, and its climate was more humid and
   equable. The hills were generally terraced and provided with
   reservoirs, as abundant ruins testify, and the sudden torrents, which
   now wash away what little soil they find, were, by these means and
   others, dispersed and absorbed by the ground. Many of the most rugged
   districts were covered with vineyards and olive-orchards, so that Deut
   8:7-9 is but a literal description of what the land once was, and, in
   particular localities, still remains. Unlimited extortion, in addition
   to heavy taxes upon every crop and every tree, even to the oak upon the
   hills, the unrestrained pillage of the harvests by Bedouins, with other
   causes, are fast abandoning this fertile land to denudation, drought,
   and the desert.

   Calendar of Labor. -- There have been few changes in the art or
   instruments of agriculture in Western Asia since ancient times. The
   present tense may therefore ordinarily be used for the past. Ploughing
   and sowing grain begin with the rainy season, and, as the ground does
   not freeze, continue, when the weather permits, till March. Then are
   sown the podded and garden plants, the melons, and all the crops which
   demand a warmer soil. Barley-harvest quickly follows the cessation of
   the latter rain, and then wheat-harvest. The remaining crops having one
   after another been brought to perfection and gathered, the droughts of
   summer now end most agricultural operations till the ingathering of the
   fig, the olive, and the grape in August and September. Occasionally,
   during the busy season, the husbandman tents upon the land he
   cultivates. Ordinarily, his home is in some village or walled town,
   perhaps miles away from his farm. In the early morning he walks or
   rides to his labor, the patient ass or the camel bearing his light
   ploughs and other implements. Thus in the parable the ""sower went forth
   to sow."" So varied is the character of the soil and climate within
   short ranges as often greatly to prolong the season of planting and
   harvesting. Grain frequently requires replanting or replacing with
   other crops. Where there are permanent streams or opportunities for
   irrigation, sowing follows harvest, crop succeeds crop through the
   entire year, and the promises of Lev 26:5 and Am 9:13 are verified.

   Crops. -- In this fertile soil, with an almost unparalleled variety of
   climate and exposure, between such points as Jericho, Hermon, and Gaza,
   there is opportunity for the cultivation of nearly all plants either of
   the torrid or temperate zones; and we find in the Bible, for such a
   book, a very extended botanic list. The variety of cultivated species
   was, however, much less than now. Wheat, barley, millet, and spelt (not
   rye) were the only cereals. Beans and lentiles were staples, while
   flax, cucumbers, fitches, cummin, and the onion family were often
   extensively cultivated. Jewish writers mention peas, lettuce, endives,
   and melons as ancient garden plants. Fruit- and nut-bearing trees were
   cultivated for the most part within enclosures.

   Methods and Instruments. -- As population increased, irrigation, by
   conducting water to the crops from brooks and reservoirs, became more
   common. The painful Egyptian labor of raising a supply from a lower
   level was rarely necessary. Such passages as Jer 9:22 show that the use
   of dung as manure was not uncommon. In Jer 4:3; Hos 10:12 there is
   reference to the practice of leaving the land fallow for a time. The
   former passage, with many others, reminds us of the great variety and
   abundance of thorny plants in Palestine, said to be one mark of a
   fertile soil. Rotation of crops seems to have been practised to some
   extent.

   The instruments of agriculture are particularly described under their
   respective titles. Oriental ploughing does not turn a sod, but merely
   scratches the earth to the depth of three or four inches at most, which
   is all the primitive and light plough and the small cattle of the East
   can do. Often -- always in the case of new ground -- a second ploughing
   crosswise was practised; and this is referred to by the word ""break"" in
   Isa 28:24. Steep hill-sides were prepared for planting with the mattock
   or hoe, an iron-pointed instrument of wood resembling in shape the
   modern ""pick."" Isa 7:25. Good farmers ploughed before the rains, that
   the moisture might be more abundantly absorbed. The seed, being
   scattered broadcast upon the soil, was ordinarily ploughed in, as is
   still the custom. Light harrowing, often with thorn-bushes, completed
   the process. In wet ground the seed was trampled in by cattle. Isa
   32:20. After its planting there was commonly little further labor
   bestowed upon the crop till it was ready for the harvest. Weeds were
   removed by hand when it was safe to do so. Matt 13:28, 1 Chr 2:29.
   Irrigation was sometimes necessary. As the ingathering drew near, the
   fields must be protected by the watchman in his lodge from the wild
   boar and other beasts, and from human marauders. The newly scattered
   seed and the ripening crop also required to be defended against great
   flocks of birds. Matt 13:4.

   Grain when ripe was, in more ancient times, plucked up by the roots.
   Later, it was reaped by a sickle resembling our own, either the ears
   alone being cut off or the whole stalk. The sheaves were never made
   into shocks ; but this word in Scripture use denotes merely a loose

   An Egyptian Threshing-Floor (From Eiehn.)

   heap of them. Laborers, animals, or carts bore the harvest to the
   threshing-floor, where, as elsewhere described, the grain was separated
   from the ears and winnowed. More delicate seeds were beaten out with a
   stick. Isa 28:27.

   Peculiarities. -- Agriculture was recognized and regulated by the
   Mosaic law as the chief national occupation. Inalienable ownership --
   under God -- of the soil was a fundamental provision, and renting the
   ground till the year of jubilee was alone possible. ""The land shall not
   be sold for ever; for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and
   sojourners with me."" Lev 25:8-10, Lev 25:23-35. The encouragement such
   a provision gave to agricultural improvements cannot be exaggerated.

   That the land must rest one year in seven was another remarkable and
   most beneficent requirement. Lev 25:1-7. The Jews were forbidden to sow
   a field with divers seeds. Deut 22:9. For example, wheat and lentiles
   must not be mixed, nor areas of them meet. The rabbis describe with
   minuteness how to vary the position of crops, yet avoid actual contact
   between them, and prescribe at least three furrows' margin between such
   divers kinds. The yoking together of an ox and ass was prohibited, but
   is common enough among the present inhabitants. Horses were never used
   for farm-work.

   Vineyards are enclosed in walls, and gardens are usually protected in
   the same way, or by banks of mud taken from ditches. Otherwise, in
   agricultural districts the absence of all fences or enclosures is, and
   always was, in striking contrast to our own practice. A brook or a
   cliff may serve as a boundary, but ordinarily large stones almost
   covered by the soil are the landmarks. Deut 19:14. Exceedingly
   beautiful to the eye are the vast fertile areas of Palestine, checkered
   only by cultivation. As cattle find pasture through most of the year,
   there are no proper barns to be seen. Grass is cut in watered places
   with a sickle for ""soiling,"" and stock is fed with this or with grain
   when the fields are dried up. More commonly, during periods of
   scarcity, the flocks and herds are driven to other feeding grounds.
   Booths are sometimes provided for inclement weather, and at night
   cattle are driven into caves or folds.

   The permission to pluck and eat a neighbor's grapes or grain, but not
   to put the former in a vessel nor use a sickle on the latter, is not to
   be forgotten. Deut 23:24,Deut 23:25. There was also merciful provision
   that the poor might glean in the vineyard and harvest-field, and that
   something should be left for them. Lev 19:9, 1 Kgs 16:10 ; Deut 24:19.

   Altogether, the agricultural laws of the Pentateuch have been
   unapproached in their wisdom and beneficence by any similar legislation
   on record. See Garden, Mowing, Plough, Seasons, Thresh, Vines, etc.","",1

135,Ahab,"A'HAB ( father's brother). 1 . Seventh king of"" Israel, b. c. 919-896.
   1 Kgs 16:29. Son and successor of Omri. He reigned twenty-two years.
   His capital was Samaria. He married Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal, king
   of Tyre, who had been priest of Astarte, but had seized the throne of
   his brother. Being a weak man, he was ruled by his ambitious and daring
   wife. Idolatry was set up in Israel. Ahab built a temple to Baal in
   Samaria, and Jezebel maintained at her own cost 400 prophets of
   Astarte. These were allowed to become the relentless persecutors of the
   servants of Jehovah, so that true religion was almost extinct. In
   punishment God sent three years of drought. Elijah had prophesied this
   event, and at its termination appeared before the king, challenged the
   false prophets to a trial of power, demonstrated their feebleness, amd
   caused them to be slain. Ahab was deeply impressed, and might have
   yielded, were it not for Jezebel, who threatened the life of Elijah,
   and by her energy prevented a reaction in favor of Jehovah. See Elijah.
   Ahab had a taste for splendid architecture; this he showed by building
   an ivory palace and several cities. But it was on the city of Jezreel
   he seems to have spent the most attention. The desire to beautify it
   led to the affair of Naboth's vineyard. This he coveted, that he might
   add it to his pleasure-grounds in Jezreel. But Naboth refused to part
   with the land for money or in exchange, for he was forbidden by the
   Levitical law. Lev 25:23. Ahab took the refusal to heart. But the
   scheming Jezebel secured Naboth's murder under orders marked with
   Ahab's seal. And thus the land passed into his hands. See Naboth. The
   Lord by Elijah denounced Ahab and Jezebel, and foretold the extinction
   of their house. But Ahab's remorse and repentance secured the
   postponement of the sentence. 1 Kgs 21.

   Ahab fought three wars or campaigns with Ben-hadad II., king of Syria,
   in the first two of which, only a year apart, both defensive, he was
   victorious. The second victory put Ben-hadad into his hands, and he was
   able to exact very favorable terms of peace -- viz. that all the
   Israelitish cities lost should be restored, and in Damascus Jewish
   officials should be permanently settled in their own houses, in order
   that they might look after the interests of Ahab and his subjects. This
   is what is meant by making ""streets"" in Damascus. 1 Kgs 20:34. For
   letting Ben-hadad go he was strikingly rebuked by a prophet, and the
   failure of his hopes prophesied. It was indeed foolish, since no pledge
   had been given by Ben-hadad; and ungrateful, because God, who had given
   the victory, was not consulted. For the next three years the kingdom
   had peace. But then Ahab in conjunction with Jehoshaphat, king of
   Judah, his son-in-law, fought Ben-hadad the third time, in order to
   recover Ramoth-gilead, which Ahab claimed belonged to him. Lying
   prophets encouraged him in his enterprise, but at Jehoshaphat's request
   Micaiah, the prophet of Jehovah, was called, who foretold his death.
   Ahab in anger imprisoned Micaiah, but still was so impressed that he
   took the precaution to disguise himself; but a certain man drew a bow
   at a venture and smote him, so that at eventide he died. His body was
   carried to Samaria; the dogs licked up his blood as a servant washed it
   from the chariot. Thus the prophecy of Elijah was partially fulfilled,
   but more exactly in the case of his son. Ahab left three children by
   Jezebel, all of whom died violent deaths; also, by other wives, seventy
   sons, who were slain by Jehu.

       council of his nobles, very likely for the purpose of arranging the
       invasion of Greece. The meeting lasted six months, and was followed
       by a munificent feast, on the seventh day of which he commanded his
       queen, Vashti, to show herself unto his drunken nobles. This she

   742-726. He was a gross idolater, and even sacrificed his children to
   the gods. He remodelled the temple to fit it for idolatrous rites. He
   kept chariot-horses dedicated to the sun. This course brought upon him
   and his kingdom severe judgments. God made them to flee before their
   enemies. Their allies often proved un faithful, and involved them in
   great distress.

   Early in his reign,probably the second year, Pekah, king of Israel, and
   Rezin, king of Syria, who, just at the close of Jotham's reign, had
   confederated for the destruction of Judah, invaded the kingdom with a
   powerful army and laid siege to Jerusalem.

   Isaiah foretold their overthrow and inspired the king. Isa 7. But the
   allies, though defeated at Jerusalem, captured Elath, wasted Judah, and
   carried 200,000 into captivity; the prophet Oded caused these to be
   restored. Ahaz in his extremity made a league with Tilgath-pilneser,
   king of Assyria, who freed him from his enemies, but at the cost of the
   Judaic kingdom, which became tributary, and Ahaz sent him all the
   treasures of the temple and his palace, and appeared before him in
   Damascus as a vassal. Neglecting the warnings of Isaiah, Hosea, and
   Micah, he ran to even greater excesses in idolatry, and indeed so
   lowered himself in the popular esteem that when he died he was refused
   a burial with his royal ancestors. 2 Chr 28:27. His only permanent
   service to his people was the introduction of the sun-dial, which was
   probably connected with the Assyrian astrology and necromancy.

   and for this reason, when he attempted to unite with Jehoshaphat in the
   gold-trade with Ophir, God caused the ships to be broken in port at
   Ezion-geber, not allowing this union between his friends and foes. See
   Jehoshaphat. Under him Moab rebelled. A fall through a lattice,
   probably from the window of his chamber in his palace in Samaria,
   occasioned his death. Characteristically, he sent to inquire at Ekron
   of Baal-zebub whether his injury would be fatal. Elijah met the
   messengers and told them that he would die. The king sent to take
   Elijah, and thus two companies of soldiers were destroyed. But with the
   third, Elijah went and told the king in person of his speedy death. 2

       governed by the advice of his infamous mother. His reign lasted
       only one year, b. c. 884. He allied himself with his uncle,
       Jehoram, king of Israel, and attacked Hazael, king of Syria, who
       defeated them at Ramoth-gilead. Jehoram was severely wounded and
       carried to his palace in Jezreel. There Ahaziah visited him. Israel
       meanwhile rebelled under Jehu. The two kings went out to meet him,
       and Jehu killed Jehoram. Ahaziah fled, and was pursued to the pass
       of Gur, where he was mortally wounded, but escaped, and died at
       Megiddo. In this way the slightly differing accounts, 2 Kgs 9:27

   During the revolt of Absalom, Zadok and Abiathar, the high priests,
   stayed in Jerusalem with Hushai, David's friend; while Ahimaaz and
   Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, stationed themselves at En-rogel, a
   short distance from the city, and the plot was that all that Hushai
   should hear respecting Absalom's plans he should communicate to Zadok
   and Abiathar, and they to their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan, by whom the
   intelligence should be communicated to David. 2 Sam 15:30. As soon as
   Absalom had rejected the counsel of Ahithophel, and adopted that of
   Hushai, Zadok and Abiathar were promptly informed of it, and directed
   their sons to go with all possible haste to David and tell him to cross
   Jordan at once. A woman bore the message. Seeing her speak to the men,
   and noticing that they ran off with haste, a lad informed Absalom of
   the suspicious event, and accordingly he ordered a pursuit. When they
   came to Bahurim, they concealed themselves in a well. The woman of the
   house covered the mouth of the well with a blanket, on which she spread
   corn to dry ; and when Absalom's messengers came up in the pursuit, and
   inquired where they were, she told them that the young men had passed
   on. Thus they escaped, and while their pursuers returned to Jerusalem
   they hastened to David with their message. 2 Sam 17:15-22.

   At his own urgent request, Ahimaaz was employed to carry the
   intelligence of Absalom's death to David, his father. He outran Cushi,
   who had been previously despatched on the same errand. Before he had
   delivered his message, however, Cushi came up, and made known the sad

   numbered, in the days of its ancient prosperity, 600,000 inhabitants
   (half of them slaves), and ranked next to Athens in literature. It had
   the greatest library of ancient times, which contained upward of
   700,000 rolls or volumes. The portion in the museum, consisting of
   400,000 volumes, was burnt in b.c. 47. The additional or ""new library""
   in the Serapeum, afterward increased to about 500,000 volumes,
   including the original 300,000 volumes, was destroyed by the fanatical
   vandalism of the Saracens in a.d. 640. At Alexandria the O. T. was
   translated into the Greek by seventy learned Jews (hence called the
   ""Septuagint""), in the third century before the Christian era. The
   Alexandrian Greek dialect, known as Hellenistic Greek, was the language
   used by the early Christian fathers, and is still the study of the
   biblical scholar in the pages of the N. T. Alexandria was the
   birthplace of Apollos, Acts 18:24, and in the apostle Paul's time, it
   carried on an extensive commerce with the countries on the
   Mediterranean. Acts 6:9; Acts 27:6; Acts 28:11. The city was the home
   of Philo, who there blended the Mosaic religion with the philosophy of
   Plato. Mark founded there a Christian church, which in later years
   became a patriarchal see, outranking Jerusalem and Antioch, being
   itself afterward outranked by Constantinople and Rome. In its
   catechetical school -- the theological seminary of those days --
   Clement and Origen taught the Christian religion, in opposition to the
   false philosophy of the Gnostic sects. In Alexandria originated the
   Arian heresy denying that Jesus Christ was divine, and there
   Athanasius, the ""father of orthodoxy,"" firmly opposed the false and
   defended the true doctrine of the deity of our Lord. From a.d. 300 to
   600 the city was second only to Rome in size and importance, and was
   the chief seat of Christian theology. It was conquered by the Saracens
   under Caliph Omar about a.d. 610, when it began to decline. The rising
   importance of Constantinople, and the discovery of an ocean passage to
   India by way of Cape Good Hope, contributed to its further ruin, until
   it was reduced from a prosperous city of half a million to a poor
   village of only 5000 to 6000 inhabitants. The plan of Alexandria on the
   next page is taken from Fairbairn's Imperial Dictionary of the Bible.

   Present Condition. -- It is now an important city of 200,000
   inhabitants (including 50,000 Franks), and is connected with Cairo by a
   railway, and also with Suez, on the Red Sea. The city has a new
   artificial harbor with a breakwater two miles long. Among the ancient
   monuments to be seen are the Catacombs, the Column of Diocletian, 94
   feet high and named ""Pompey's Pillar"" -- not from the famous Pompey,
   but from a Roman prefect who erected the

   column in honor of the emperor Diocletian -- and one of the two
   obelisks or ""Needles of Cleopatra,"" which, however, belong to the time
   of the Pharaohs and were brought from Heliopolis. One was transferred
   to London in 1878, and now adorns the embankment of the Thames; the
   other is to be removed to the city of New York (1880).","",1

207,Alliance,"ALLI'ANCE. The Jews were in intention a peculiar people, designed to
   live apart from all other nations. But they frustrated this design, and
   leagued themselves in offensive and defensive treaties with the
   surrounding governments. We know so little of the details of these
   affairs that we cannot always be sure just when they took place. But it
   is noticeable that the decay of the Jewish state in purity is
   synchronous with a desire to receive outside help. They left God for
   man. Before the state arose, alliances were indeed formed by the
   patriarchs, Gen 21:27-32; Gen 26 : 28, 29 ; Gen 31:44-54, but they were
   of very limited extent. When the Israelites invaded Palestine they were
   forbidden to ally themselves with the inhabitants, but the Gibeonites
   fraudulently made a treaty with them, to which Israel abode faithful.
   Josh 9. David and Solomon made an alliance with Tyre, 2 Sam 5:11;

   1 Kgs 5:1-12, but it was for pacific ends. When, however, the
   disruption took place, both Judah and Israel looked to neighboring
   states for assistance in their ""intestine internecine wars."" By means
   of these foreigners idolatry was introduced, the national purity
   eventually destroyed, and the anger of God thus excited.

   Alliances were made by an oath between the parties, who in solemn
   fashion passed between the parts of an equally divided victim. Gen
   15:10; Jer 34:18-20. A feast followed. Gen 26:30 ; 2 Sam 3:20. Salt,
   symbol of fidelity to this day in the East, was used; hence the phrase

   leaf, flower, and fruit. The fruit is green, almost pulpless, and
   shrivels off in September, leaving the nuts, for which the tree is
   chiefly valued, and which the sons of Jacob carried down to the
   governor of Egypt, a country where almonds seem to have been rare. Gen
   43:11. ""Hazel,"" in Gen 30:37, probably denotes this tree. The bowls of
   the sacred candlestick were made like unto almonds, Ex 25:33, by which
   name of ""almonds"" English workmen to this day call the pieces of glass
   used to ornament branch candlesticks. Aaron's rod that budded yielded
   this fruit. Num 17:8.

   In January, before flowers appear on other trees, they adorn the naked
   twigs of the almond. Hence the allusion of the poet:

   ""The hope, in dreams of a happier hour. That alights on Misery's brow,
   Springs out of the silvery almond-flower. That blooms on a leafless
   bough.""

   The Hebrew name for this tree, doubtless suggested by its early
   blooming, means hasten, which explains Jer 1:11, Jer 1:12; ""the word of
   the Lord came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou ? And I said,
   I see a rod of an almond (hasten) tree. Then said the Lord unto me,
   Thou hast well seen; for I will hasten my word to perform it."" The

   e.g. Job 31:17; Ps 41:1 and Ps 112:9. In the temple there was one box
   for the reception of alms to be dedicated to the education of the poor
   children of good family. Alms-giving was a part of Pharisaic practice.
   Our Lord did not rebuke them for it, but for their self-satisfaction in

220,Altar,"AL'TAR. Gen 8:20. A structure appropriated exclusively to the offering
   of sacrifices, under the Jewish law. See Sacrifices. Though sacrifices
   were offered before the Flood, the word altar does not occur until the
   time of Noah's departure from the ark.

   Altars were of various forms, and at first rude in their construction,
   being nothing more, probably, than a square heap of stones or mound of
   earth. The altar on which Jacob made an offering at Bethel was the
   single stone which had served him for a pillow during the night. Gen
   28:18. Primarily for sacrifice, they seem at times to have been built
   for a witness merely, to mark the spot of God's appearance or other
   memorable event. Gen 12:7;Ex 17:15, Ex 17:16; Josh 22:10-29. The altar
   which Moses was commanded to build, Ex 20:24, was to be made of earth.
   If made of stone, it was expressly required to be rough, the use of a
   tool being regarded as polluting, Ex 20:25, but this refers only to the
   body of the altar and that part on which the victim was laid, as is
   evident from the directions given for making a casing of shittim-wood
   and overlaying it with brass for the altar of burnt-offering. It was
   also to be without steps. Ex 20:26. See also Deut 27:2-6 and Josh 8:31.
   The law of Moses forbade the erection of altars except in the
   tabernacle; yet even pious Israelites disobeyed the letter of this law,
   for Gideon, Samuel, David, and Solomon are mentioned as setting up
   altars. The temple altar was an asylum; e.g. 1 Kgs 1:50. Altars were
   used in idol-worship; and because they were often erected on high
   places they acquired the name of ""high places.""

   The structures are different, as well as the apparent ornaments and
   uses. On representations of them are projections upward at each corner,
   which represent the true figure of the horns. Ex 27:2; 1 Kgs 2:28; Rev
   9:13. They were probably used to confine the victim. Ps 118:27.

   The altars required in the Jewish worship were:

   (1). ""The altar of burnt-offering,"" or the ""brazen altar,"" in the
   tabernacle in the wilderness. This altar stood directly in front of the
   principal entrance. It was made of shittim-wood (acacia), seven feet
   and six inches square, and four feet and six inches high. It was hollow
   and overlaid with plates of brass. The horns -- of which there was one
   on each corner -- were of wood, and overlaid in the same way. A grate
   or net-work of brass was also attached to it, either to hold the fire
   or to support a hearth of earth. The furniture of the altar was all of
   brass, and consisted of, 1. a shovel to remove the ashes from the
   altar; 2. a pan to receive them; 3. basins for receiving the blood of
   the victims and removing it; 4. hooks for turning the sacrifice; 5.
   fire-pans, or perhaps censers, for carrying coals from the fire or for
   burning incense. At each corner was a brass ring, and there were also
   two staves or rods overlaid with brass, which passed through these
   rings, and served for carrying

   Altar of Burnt-Offering in the Tabernacle.

   the altar from place to place. The altar is described in Ex 27. The
   ""compass"" referred to, v. 1 Chr 6:5, was a ledge running all around the
   altar about midway from the ground -- affording a convenient place for
   the priest to stand while offering sacrifice -- supported by a brass
   net-like grating. The fire used on this altar was kindled miraculously
   and was perpetually maintained. It was also a place of constant
   sacrifice.

   In the first temple, which in its general plan was constructed after
   the pattern of the tabernacle in the wilderness, the altar of
   burnt-offering stood in the same relative position as in the
   tabernacle. It was much larger, however, being thirty feet square and
   fifteen feet high, its particular plan being appointed

   Altar of Burnt-Offering; in the Temple. (From Surenhusius's Mishna.)

   expressly by divine authority. It was made entirely of bronze plates,
   which covered a structure of earth or stone. 2 Chr 4:1. In the second
   temple it occupied the same position, though it was still larger and
   more beautiful than in the first. An inclined plane led in each case up
   to the altar, since express command forbade the Jews using steps. Ex
   20:26.

   (2). The ""altar of incense,"" or the ""golden altar,"" stood within the
   holy place and near to the inmost veil. Ex 30:1-6. It was made of the
   same wood with the brazen altar, and was eighteen inches square and
   three feet high. The top, as well as the sides and horns, was overlaid
   with pure gold, and it was finished around the upper surface

   Altar of Incense.

   with a crown or border of gold. Just below this border four golden
   rings were attached to each side of the altar, one near each corner.
   The staves or rods for bearing the altar passed through these rings,
   and were made of the same wood with the altar itself, and richly
   overlaid with the same precious metal. Upon this altar incense was
   burned every morning and every evening (see Incense), so that it was
   literally perpetual. Ex 30:8. The ""altar of incense"" in Solomon's
   temple was made of cedar overlaid with gold. Neither burnt-sacrifice,
   nor meat-offering, nor drink-offering, was permitted upon this altar,
   nor was it ever stained with blood, except once annually, when the
   priest made atonement. Lev 16:18, Acts 1:19.

   hesitation he sent them home. Amaziah met the Edomites in a place
   called the Valley of Salt, and gained a signal victory over them,
   slaying 10,000 and taking 10,000 prisoners. Elated by his success, and
   forgetful of God who had given him the victory, he set up the idols of
   his vanquished enemy as his own gods. The anger of the Almighty was
   kindled against him, and in a message God exposed and rebuked his sin.
   2 Chr 25:15. The king was already hardened enough to question the
   authority of God's messenger, and even to threaten him with death. Thus
   given up to follow his own devices, he sought occasion of war with
   Jehoash, king of Israel. The answer of the king to the challenge was
   given in the form of a fable expressive of the utmost contempt, and
   contained at the same time a severe rebuke to the king of Judah for his
   pride and vainglory. Undeterred, he met the army of Israel at
   Beth-shemesh, in Judea, but his army was completely routed, and he was
   taken prisoner, Jehoash then proceeded to break down a section of the
   city wall six hundred feet in length, and marched through the breach,
   plundered the temple of its gold and silver vessels, seized the king's
   treasures, and taking such hostages as he pleased returned in triumph
   to Samaria. 2 Kgs 14. About fifteen years after this disgraceful
   defeat, Amaziah fled from Jerusalem to Lachish to escape a conspiracy;
   but he was followed to the place to which he fled and put to death, and
   his body taken back to Jerusalem and buried with his fathers. His name
   is omitted in the genealogy of Christ.

   affirmative response to an oath. The word was often repeated. It is a
   matter of tradition that in the temple the ""Amen"" was not uttered by
   the people, but that instead, at the conclusion of the priest's
   prayers, they responded, ""Blessed be the name of the glory of His
   kingdom for ever and ever."" Of this a trace is supposed to remain in
   the concluding sentence of the Lord's Prayer. Comp. Rom 11:36. But in
   the synagogue and private houses it was customary for the people or
   members of the family who were present to say ""Amen"" to the prayers
   which were offered by the minister or master of the house, and the
   custom remained in the early Christian Church. Matt 6:13; 1 Cor 14:16.
   Doxologies and private prayers were appropriately closed with ""Amen.""
   It is sometimes translated verily, and was frequently used by our
   Saviour when he was about to utter some distinct, important, and solemn
   truth. Its repetition, ""Verily, verily, I say unto you"" (in John)
   strengthens the assertion.

   AM'MON, AND AMMONITES, LAND OF, etc., a mountainous country on the east
   side of the Salt Sea, reaching from the river Arnon to the Jabbok. Num
   21:24; Deut 2:19,Gen 23:20. It lay to the north of the land of Moab;
   and ""the land,"" ""borders,"" or ""cities"" of the children of Ammon are
   noticed over 15 times in Old Testament history, and frequently with
   Moab. The precise extent of their country cannot be determined, as they
   appear to have led a wandering, predatory life similar to that of the
   wild Arab tribes now in that region. Gilead was the best portion of
   their land. Among the cities held by them, sometimes, apparently, in
   common with Moab, were Heshbon, Rabbah, and Minnith. The land which the
   king of Ammon claimed in the time of the Judges, Jud 11:13, once
   belonged to a ""king of Moab."" Num 21:26.","",1
255,Ammonites,"AMMONITES, or CHILDREN OF AM'MON, Gen 19:38, were the descendants of
   Ben-ammi, a son of Lot. He was born in the neighborhood of Zoar, but
   his posterity spread northwardly and occupied the mountain regions of
   Gilead, between the rivers Arnon and Jabbok. Originally their
   possessions were bounded north by the river Jabbok, west by Jordan,
   south by Arnon, and stretched eastwardly into Arabia. The Amorites,
   under Sihon, their king, expelled them from the richest part of their
   possessions, which lay between the two rivers; but Moses recovered it
   from the Amorites and divided it between Reuben and Gad. The western
   boundary of the Ammonites then became a branch of the river Jabbok (on
   which their capital city, Rabbah or Rabbath-Ammon, stood), and the
   mountains of Gilead bounded them on the east, while the main stream of
   the Jabbok continued to be their northern boundary, and the land of
   Moab the southern. This last is intended by the kingdom of Ammon as
   used in the sacred history.

   The children of Ammon were gross idolaters. Jud 10:6. Their chief idol
   was Molech, the same with Milcom, and their history is full of the
   judgments which their sins brought upon them, though they were spared,
   by God's express command, when Israel passed by them from Egypt,
   because Lot was their progenitor. Deut 2:19; 2 Chr 20:10. Three hundred
   years afterward the king of the Ammonites made war upon the Israelites,
   under the pretence that they had taken their land, Jud 11:13, and after
   a severe battle the Ammonites were routed with great slaughter. In the
   beginning of Saul's reign, 1 Sam 11:1, the Ammonites, under Nahash,
   their king, attacked Jabesh-gilead, but proposed to spare the
   inhabitants provided they would all consent to lose the right eye.
   During the time allowed for their answer they collected a sufficient
   force to meet the Ammonites, and so completely routed them that two of
   them were not left together. Fifty or sixty years after this one of the
   kings of the Ammonites died, and David, who seems to have been under
   some obligation to him, sent a message of condolence to his son and
   successor. This friendly act was not received kindly, and the
   messengers of David were grossly abused and insulted. See Hanun.
   Expecting that David would attempt to revenge the insult, they obtained
   large supplies of men from the Syrians; and when David heard of their
   preparation for war, he sent Joab, with a chosen troop from the army of
   Israel, to meet them. The result was fatal to the Ammonites. They and
   their allies were subdued, and fled. Rabbah, their capital, and all the
   rest of their cities were afterward destroyed by the Israelites, the
   king's crown was taken from his head and put on David's head, and the
   people were reduced to a state of abject servitude. 2 Sam 12:26-31. In
   this condition they remained till the reign of Jehoshaphat, when they
   united with the Moabites and others and made war upon Judah, and were
   miraculously cut off. 2 Chr 20. Jotham fought and prevailed against
   them, and made them tributary for several years. Many Jews sought
   refuge among them in the time of the Captivity, but they do not seem to
   have decreased their hostile feeling. The most dreadful judgments were
   threatened against them and their chief city because they seized and
   occupied a part of the territory of Israel, Jer 49:1-6, and again
   because they insolently triumphed over the Israelites in the days of
   their captivity, Eze 25:2-7, 1 Kgs 16:10; and every threat was executed
   to the very uttermost in due time, as profane history abundantly
   attests. ""During the time of the Maccabees various battles were fought
   between the Ammonites and the Jews; and during the changes that ensued,
   first under the Grecian, then under the Roman supremacy, the Ammonites
   lost their independent position, and gradually became amalgamated with
   the general Arab population."" They were a cruel, remorseless, nomadic
   people. To their god Molech they offered human sacrifices. See Molech.

   country, being bounded on three sides by the rivers Arnon, Jabbok, and
   Jordan. See Ammonites. The Israelites asked permission of their king to
   travel through their territory, promising to injure nothing, not even
   to draw water from their wells; but it was refused. The Amorites
   collected and attempted to oppose their progress, but were defeated,
   and their territory taken and divided between the tribes of Reuben and
   Gad. Josh 13:15, 2 Chr 11:21, Jud 6:24, Gen 1:27. Nothing more is heard

   king of Israel, about eight hundred years before Christ. He was a
   contemporary of Hosea. While employed as a herdsman he was divinely
   appointed to prophesy against Israel. This kingdom then was in its
   heyday of prosperity, but by reason of its idolatry rife with the seeds
   of ruin. It was Amos's duty to speak plain words upon the evils of the
   state. Being driven from Bethel upon the false representation made to
   the king by the idolatrous Priest Amaziah. Am 7:10-7, he returned to

   Amos, Prophecy of, is the thirtieth in the order of the books of the
   Old Testament, and is full of interest and instruction. It may be
   considered as a sort of continuation of Joel's. It is a unit. It begins
   with the declaration of God's judgments against Israel's neighbors. But
   in this storm of fury Judah does not escape while Israel stands the
   brunt of it. Am 1-2:6. The sins of Israel are rebuked. Am 2:6-6:14. The
   rebukes are followed by a series of symbols, which are interpreted. Am
   7:1-9:7. But the book closes with the promise of good. The ""tabernacle
   of David"" is to be restored. Thus the beauty and perpetuity of the
   Christian Church are foretold. It has been remarked as a peculiar

290,Angel,"AN'GEL. Gen 24:7. This word, both in the Greek and Hebrew languages,
   signifies a messenger, and in this sense is often applied to men. 2 Sam
   2:5; Luke 7:24 and Luke 9:52. When the term is used, as it generally
   is, to designate spiritual beings, it denotes the office they sustain
   as the agents by whom God makes known his will and executes his
   government.

   Our knowledge of such beings is derived wholly from revelation, and
   that rather incidentally. We know, from their residence and employment,
   that they must possess knowledge and purity far beyond our present
   conceptions, and the titles applied to them denote the exalted place
   they hold among created intelligences. Christ did not come to the
   rescue of angels, but of men. Comp. Heb 2:16. The angels are
   represented as ministering spirits sent forth to do service to the
   heirs of salvation. Heb 1:14. They appear at every important stage in
   the history of revelation, especially at the birth of Christ, Luke
   2:9-13, in his agony in Gethsemane, Luke 22:43, at his resurrection.
   Matt 28:2; Mark 16:5; Luke 24:4, and at the final judgment. Matt 13:41.

   Of their appearance and employment we may form some idea from the
   following passages -- viz. Gen 16:7-11. Compare Gen 18:2; Gen 19:1 with
   Heb 13:2; Jud 13:6; Eze 10; Dan 3:28 and Dan 6:22; Matt 4:11; Matt
   18:10 and Matt 28:2-7; Luke 1:19; Luke 16:22 and Luke 22:43; Acts 6:15;
   Acts 12:7; Heb 1:14; Heb 2:16; 2 Thess 1:7; Rev 10:1, Lev 10:2, 1 Chr
   24:6.

   Of their number some idea may be inferred from 1 Kgs 22:19; Ps 68:17;
   Dan 7:10; Matt 26:53; Luke 2:9-14; 1 Cor 4:9; Heb 12:22.

   Of their strength we may judge from Ps 103:20; 2 Pet 2:11; Rev 5:2; Rev
   18:21; Rev 19:17.

   And we learn their inconceivable activity from Jud 13:20; Isa 6:2-6;
   Matt 13:49; Matt 26:53; Acts 27:23; Rev 8:13.

   There is also an order of evil spirits ministering to the will of the
   prince of darkness, and both active and powerful in their opposition to
   God. Matt 25:41.

   It would seem the proper inference from Matt 18:10 that every believer
   had a guardian angel. The same idea is suggested in other passages, as
   Ps 91:11, Jer 1:12; Luke 15:10; Acts 12:15.

   They are the companions of the saved. Heb 12:22, Heb 12:23; Rev 5:11,
   Rev 5:12. They are to sustain an important office in the future and
   final administration of God's government on earth. Matt 13:39; Matt
   25:31-33; 1 Thess 4:16. But they are not proper objects of adoration.
   Col 2:18; Rev 19:10.

   Angel of his Presence, Isa 63:9, by some is supposed to denote the
   highest angel in heaven, as Gabriel, who stands ""in the presence of
   God,"" Luke 1:19; but others believe it refers to the incarnate Word.

   Angel of the Lord, Gen 16:7, is considered, by some, one of the common
   titles of Christ in the Old Testament. Ex 23:20. Compare Acts 7:30-32
   andActs 7:37, Acts 7:38.

   Angel of the Church. Rev 2:1.

   The only true interpretation of this phrase is the one which makes the
   angels the rulers and teachers of the congregation, so called because
   they were the ambassadors of God to the churches, and on them devolved
   the pastoral care and government.

   Angel of Light. See Devil.

   AN'GER, a strong emotion, which is sinful or otherwise according to its
   object and motive. When ascribed to holy beings it is used figuratively
   to denote high displeasure at sin. In this sense good men may be angry
   and sin not, Eph 4:26; Neh 5:6; cf. 2 Pet 2:7,2 Pet 2:8; and even God
   is said to be ""angry with the wicked every day."" Ps 7:11. Unjustified
   anger is reckoned among chief sins, and as such is severely rebuked.

   writers mention it as cultivated in Egypt; it grows in the Greek
   islands, and occurs at the present day in Palestine, both in gardens
   and wild, or at least uncultivated in fields. -- Tristram. Another
   plant (Pimpinella auisuin) of the same family has been considered, with
   less probability, to be the anise of the Bible.

   her attendance on the services of the temple. She did not, however,
   live in the temple itself. At eighty-four years of age she listened to
   the prophetic blessing which Simeon uttered when he held the infant
   Redeemer in his arms, and joined in it with great fervor.","",1
297,Annas,"AN'NAS, the son of Seth, and a high priest of the Jews. He was
   appointed by Quirinus, governor of Syria, a.d. 7, and was removed by
   Valerius Gratius, procurator of Judaea, a.d. 23. The office was
   originally held for life, but in Judaea's degenerate and dependent
   position it was one of the spoils of office, to be given to the ruler's
   favorite, and to be taken away upon the loss of favor. After his
   deposition Annas continued to hold the title; and although Caiaphas,
   his son-in-law, was the actual high priest, he was the ruling power.
   This explains the reference in Luke 3:2. This power he retained for
   nearly fifty years, having had five sons in succession in the high
   priest's office. Our Lord was brought first before Annas on the night
   of his seizure. John 18:13-24. The guilt of Christ's crucifixion rests
   most upon Annas, since Pilate tried to shield him, and Caiaphas was but
   his tool. Annas is mentioned as the president of the Sanhedrin, before
   whom Peter and John were brought. Acts 4:6.","",1
298,Anoint,"ANOINT' Gen 31:13. The first biblical instance is in the passage cited,
   and it signifies in that connection the pouring of oil upon the stone
   which Jacob had set up for a pillar. Gen 28:18.

   The anointing of persons, places, and things with oil or ointment of a
   particular composition was a mode of consecration prescribed by divine
   authority, and extensively practised among the Hebrews. Ex 28:41. The
   ingredients of the ointment, embracing the most exquisite perfumes and
   balsams, are minutely given, Ex 30:23-33, and the common use of it was
   expressly forbidden. Ex 30:33.

   It was customary at festivals, and on other great and joyful occasions,
   to anoint the head with fragrant oil; hence it became a sign of joy or
   happiness; the omission of anointing was therefore a sign of grief. For
   instances see Ruth 3:3; 2 Sam 14:2; Ps 23:5; 92:10; Eccl 9:8; Matt
   6:17. Prophets, 1 Kgs 19:16;1 Chr 16:22, priests, and kings were
   solemnly anointed, and thus set apart to their respective offices. Of
   the anointing of the latter we have frequent accounts. 2 Sam 19:10;1
   Kgs 1:39; 1 Kgs 19:15, Ex 17:16. The perfumed oil or ointment was
   usually poured upon the head of the person. It was sometimes done
   privately by a prophet, 1 Sam 10:1;1 Sam 16:1-13; 1 Kgs 19:16; 2 Kgs
   9:1-6, and was a symbolical intimation that the person so anointed
   would at some future day ascend the throne. After the monarchy was
   established the anointing was done by the priest, 1 Kgs 1:39, probably
   in some public place, 1 Kgs 1:32-34, and, at least on one occasion, in
   the temple, surrounded by the royal guards. 2 Kgs 11:12, 2 Kgs 11:13.
   David was anointed three times -- privately by Samuel before Saul's
   death, to give him a claim to the throne, 1 Sam 16:1-13; again publicly
   as king over Judah in Hebron, 2 Sam 2:4; and finally, over the whole
   nation. 2 Sam 5:3. In regard to the priest's anointing, at first it was
   part of the induction into office of any priest, Ex 40:15 ; Num 3:3,
   but afterward it was a rite practised only in the case of the high
   priest. Lev 8:12; Ps 133:2.

   It was common to anoint the person, or some part of it, as the head,
   feet, hair, etc., for the sake of health or cleanliness, or as a token
   of respect, and also in connection with religious observances. Mark
   6:13; Luke 7:46; John 12:3. When practised to show respect, the most
   expensive materials were used, and the ceremony was performed in such a
   manner as to denote the most humble and submissive reverence.

   The anointing of the sick with oil was also common. The healing
   properties of oil are well known; and though the cures wrought by the
   disciples of our Lord were obviously miraculous, they still employed
   the ordinary means of cure. Mark 6:13. The apostolic direction, Jas
   5:14, respecting the anointing of the sick shows us that, together with
   prayer, the appropriate means of healing should be employed in
   dependence upon or in the name of the Lord. The ceremony was not in its
   nature obligatory, and surely no sufficient warrant for the rite of
   ""extreme unction.""

   The bodies of the dead were often wrapped in spices and ointments to
   preserve them from corruption. Mark 14:8;Mark 16:1, and Luke 23:56.

   The terms ""anoint,"" ""anointed,"" and ""anointing"" are employed also
   spiritually to illustrate the sanctifying influences of divine grace
   upon the soul. 2 Cor 1:21;1 John 2:20,Gen 1:27.

   To anoint the eyes with eye-salve, Rev 3:18, is a figurative expression
   for the gift of spiritual illumination.

   The Anointed, or Messiah, who is constituted our High Priest and
   Intercessor, was anointed with the Holy Ghost, of which anointing that
   of the priests under the Jewish dispensation is supposed to be typical.
   Ps 45:7; Isa 61:1; Dan 9:24; Luke 4:18,Ezr 8:21; Acts 4:27 and Acts
   10:38. See Messiah.

   ANT. Prov 6:6 and Prov 30:25. A small insect remarkable for industry,
   economy, and architectural skill. These creatures are called by an
   inspired Writer ""exceeding wise,"" Prov 30:24, and Cicero was so filled
   with wonder at their wisdom that he declared they must have mind,
   reason, and memory.

   The ants were described by the ancients ""as ascending the stalks of
   cereals and gnawing off the grains, while others below detached the
   seed from the chaff"" and carried it home; as gnawing off the radicle to
   prevent germination, and spreading their stores in the sun to dry after
   wet weather."" The proverb ''As provident as an ant"" was no less common
   among the people of the Mediterranean shores than ""As busy as a bee"" is
   with us. Hesiod spoke of the time-- ""When the provident one [the ant]
   harvests the grain.""

   Naturalists and commentators for a long time have been accustomed to
   deny the truth of such ideas. It is, however, now acknowledged that in
   such warm climates as Palestine these insects are dormant but a short
   time during the cooler season, and that they do store up large
   quantities of grain and seed, and dry them after rain. The writer has
   often seen in Judaea a quart or two of chaff and seeds upon ant-hills.
   This the ants were bringing out to dry in the morning, and carrying
   into their nests as it grew damp toward night.

   J. T. Muggridge, F. L. S., advances proof to confirm the ancient view,
   in the case of two species common around the Mediterranean. He has
   discovered the granaries, sometimes excavated in solid rock, in which
   the seeds are stored. He has seen the ants in the act of collecting
   seeds, and traced seeds to the granaries; he has seen them bring out
   the grains to dry after a rain, and nibble off the radicle from those
   which were germinating, and feed on the seed so collected. From these
   granaries Mr.M. collected the seeds of fifty-four species of plants. In
   one instance the masses of seeds of clover and other small plants taken
   from a single nest weighed, by careful estimate, over a pound. That the
   amount of grain gathered by ants was not unworthy of notice appears
   from the fact that the Mishna, or traditionary law of the Jews,
   adjudicates upon the ownership of such stores when found by the people.

   Of the 104 species of European ants, only two are known to store seeds.
   But these two, called ""harvesting-ants,"" are abundant in the Levant;
   hence the familiarity of the ancients with them. The prudence of this
   insect, as well as its industry, may therefore properly instruct us.
   That the ant is in every respect ""exceeding wise"" is evident from its
   history and habits, which have been investigated by modern naturalists.
   Their habitations are constructed with regular stories, sometimes to
   the number of thirty or forty, and have large chambers, numerous
   vaulted ceilings covered with a single roof, long galleries and
   corridors, with pillars or columns of very perfect proportions.

   The materials of their buildings, such as earth, leaves, and the
   fragments of wood, are tempered with rain, and then dried in the sun.
   By this process the fabric becomes so firm and compact that a piece may
   be broken out without any injury to the surrounding parts; and it is so
   nearly impervious that the longest and most violent rains never
   penetrate more than a quarter of an inch.

   They are well sheltered in their chambers, the largest of which is
   placed nearly in the centre of the building. It is much higher than the
   rest, and all the galleries terminate in it. In this apartment they
   spend the night and the cold months, during which they are torpid, or
   nearly so, and require not the food which they lay up.

   To illustrate their industry and immense labor, it is said that their
   edifices are more than five hundred times the height of the builders,
   and that if the same proportion were preserved between human dwellings
   and those who build them, our houses would be four or five times higher
   than the pyramids of Egypt, the largest of which is four hundred and
   eighty feet in height, and requires a base of seven hundred feet square
   to support it. The largest of one species of ant (the South American)
   does not stand more than a quarter of an inch high, while their nests
   or houses are from twelve to twenty feet high, and large enough to hold
   a dozen men.

   AN'TICHRIST. This word occurs only in the Epistles of John.
   Etymologically, it may mean either one who is opposed to Christ or one
   who sets himself up in the place of Christ. Comp. ""anti-pope,""
   ""rival-king."" A comparison of the four passages in which the word is
   found,1 John 2:18,Lev 19:22;1 John 4:3; 2 John 7, shows that John meant
   to designate various persons holding heretical opinions in regard to
   the incarnation of Christ. "" very spirit that confesseth not that Jesus
   Christ is come in the flesh is not of God; and this is that spirit of
   antichrist."" 1 John 4:3. He directs his warnings against this spirit as
   an existent evil; ""Even now are there many antichrists,"" 1 John 2:18;
   ""Even now already is it in the world."" 1 John 4:3. We know that in
   John's day there were in the Church false teachers who denied the union
   of the divine and human in Christ and resolved the history of Christ
   into a mere phantom or myth. Such were Cerinthus and the early Gnostics
   (who have their followers in the modern assailants of the gospel
   history).

   But this use of the word by the apostle does not exhaust its meaning.
   It can be also applied to all enemies of Christ, and to all those
   doctrines and influences which tend to set up against the simplicity of
   gospel truth the traditions or speculations of men, thus weakening or
   destroying the force of the former.

   We should not confound the antichrist of John's Epistles with the
   beasts from the abyss, or the antagonistic worldpowers described in
   Daniel and in Revelation. More nearly related to antichrist, and yet
   distinct, is ""the man of sin."" 2 Thess 2:3.","",1
299,Antioch,"AN'TIOCH (from Antiochus), the name of two cities in New Testament
   times.
    1. Antioch in Syria, founded by Seleucus Nicator, about 300 b. c., and
       enlarged and newly walled by Antiochus Epiphanes.

   Coin of Antiochus Epiphanes.

   Situation. -- This city was about 300 miles north of Jerusalem, on the
   left bank of the river Orontes, 16 1/2 miles from the Mediterranean, in
   a deep pass between the Lebanon and the Taurus ranges of mountains. It
   was sometimes called ""the gate of the East,"" being on the highway from
   the countries on the Mediterranean to Mesopotamia and Arabia.

   Biblical History. -- Next to Jerusalem, no city is of greater interest
   or importance in apostolic history than Antioch in Syria. At this place
   the disciples were first called Christians, Acts 11:26; it was an
   important centre for the spread of the gospel, Acts 13; from it Paul
   started on his missionary journeys, Acts 15:36; Acts 18:23; important
   principles of Christian faith and practice were raised and settled
   through the church at Antioch, Acts 14:26, Acts 14:27; Acts 15:2-30;
   Gal 2:11-14. It was made a ""free"" city by Pompey, was beautified by
   the; emperors with aqueducts, baths, and public buildings; and in
   Paul's time it ranked third in population, wealth. and commercial
   activity among the cities of the Roman empire. Christianity gained such
   strength there, that in the time of Chrysostom, who was born at
   Antioch, one-half of the 200, 000 inhabitants of the city were
   Christians.

   Antioch in Syria. (After Cassas. From Lewin's ""Life of St. Paul"")

   Present Condition. -- Antioch has been besieged and plundered 15 times,
   and 7 times destroyed by earthquakes, yet the remains of its ancient
   walls astonish the traveller. They were 50 feet high and 15 feet thick.
   The old town, which was 5 miles long, is now represented by a mean,
   shrunken-looking place of about 6000 population, called Antakieh. An
   earthquake in 1872 overthrew nearly one half of the houses; since then
   almost a new town has sprung up, and near by is a silk-factory, and on
   the river water-wheels for irrigating the gardens. Through the Lake of
   Antioch flows the Nahr el-Aswad, or "" black brook,"" the Melanes of
   classic history, which empties into the Orontes 3 or 4 miles above
   Antioch. Though the modern city is on a beautiful and exceedingly
   fertile plain between the mountains, and watered by the Orontes, the
   interior of the town appears to consist ""of dreary heaps of ruins, and
   unsightly, patched, and dilapidated houses, interspersed with rubbish
   and garbage."" (See Baedeker's Palestine and Syria, p. 578.)
    1. Antioch in or near Pisidia was also founded or rebuilt by Seleucus
       Nicator. It was situated on a ridge -- Strabo calls it a ""height""
       -- near the foot of the mountain-range, and by the northern shore
       of Lake Eyerdie. Paul preached there, Acts 13:14; Acts 14:21, and
       was persecuted by the people, 2 Tim 3:11. It was formerly
       erroneously located at Ak-aber, but has lately been identified with
       Yalabatch, directly east of Ephesus and northwest of ancient
       Tarsus. Ruins of walls, theatres, and churches still exist there.","",1

   Caesarea, Acts 23:31, about 26 miles south-east of the latter and 10
   miles north-east of Joppa, according to ancient authority. Some have
   located it at Kefr Saba, on the plain, 40 miles north-west of
   Jerusalem; Wilson and Conder place it at Kala'at Ras el 'Ain, ruins
   between Lydda and Caesarea, 30 miles south-east of the latter and 11
   miles north-east of Joppa. The old Roman road from Jerusalem runs to
   this place, and thence to Caesarea. ""One of the finest springs in the
   country is near."" It did not seem probable to Wilson and Conder that
   any large town like Antipatris had been at Kefr Saba.

   ANTO'NIA, a castle or fortress built by Herod, north-west of the temple
   in Jerusalem, and named by him after his friend Antony. It may be the

306,Apes,"APES. 1 Kgs 10:22. Probably a generic term for a variety of animals of
   the monkey-tribe. The rude resemblance of these creatures to the human
   race, both in figure and physical capacity, is well known. Apes are not
   natives of Palestine or adjacent regions, but were among the articles
   of merchandise imported from Ophir in Solomon's ships.

   The ape was an object of worship among the Egyptians, and is still such
   in many parts of India. We have an account of a temple in India,
   dedicated to the worship of the ape, supported by seven hundred columns
   not inferior to those of the Roman Pantheon. An ape's tooth was found
   by the Portuguese when they pillaged the island of Ceylon many years
   since, and so desirous were they to redeem it as an object of devout
   worship that the kings of the country offered nearly seventy-five

       15:53.
    2. A city of Asher, Josh 19:30, in the north of Palestine, near Sidon,
       Josh 13:4; supposed to be the same as Aphik, Jud 1:31, and the
       classical Aphaca, noted in later history for its temple of Venus;

       No. 3, as some have suggested.
    5. A walled city in the plains of Syria, on the road to Damascus. 1

315,Apocrypha," APOC'RYPHA (hidden), the name applied most commonly to the uncanonical
   books that have been added to the Old Testament.
    1. Old Testament Apocrypha. -- They are

   fourteen in number. I. 1 Esdras; II. 2 Esdras; III. Tobit; IV. Judith;
   V. The rest of the chapters of the book of Esther, which are found
   neither in the Hebrew nor in the Chaldee; VI. The Wisdom of Solomon;
   VII. Ecclesiasticus, or the Wisdom of Jesus the Son of Sirach; VIII.
   Baruch; IX. The Song of the Three Holy Children; X. The History of
   Susanna; XI. The History of the Destruction of Bel and the Dragon; XII.
   The Prayer of Manasses, King of Judah; XIII. 1 Maccabees; XIV. 2
   Maccabees. They do not exist in Hebrew, but were written in Greek,
   mostly in Alexandria. Though often quoted by the fathers, they were not
   esteemed as highly as the Scriptures. They are of great value as
   conveying historical information and containing many instructive
   sayings and examples. They fill up the gap between the Old and New
   Testaments. But they are without divine authority, and cannot be used
   in support of any doctrine or practice. They are found in the
   Septuagint, the Vulgate, and all Roman Catholic Bibles, since all but
   the two books of Esdras and the Prayer of Manasses were pronounced by
   the Council of Trent a part of the canonical Scriptures. They were
   likewise printed in Protestant Bibles and by the British and Foreign
   Bible Society until 1826, when, after a long controversy, it resolved
   to omit them from all future editions. The American Bible Society
   followed its example.
    1. New Testament Apocrypha. -- These are various spurious gospels,
       histories, biographies, and epistles. They are never printed in
       Bibles. They are immensely inferior to the genuine books. Many of
       them are pious frauds, perpetrated with the design of enhancing the
       glory of Christ and his apostles, but by their nonsensical stories
       they not only utterly fail of their object, but rather bring their
       heroes into contempt. They confirm, however, the canonical Gospels,
       as counterfeits presuppose the genuine coins. See Canon.","",1
316,Apollonia,"APOLLO'NIA (belonging to Apollo), the name of several places in Europe
   and Asia, of which Apollonia in Illyria was the most celebrated. But
   the Apollonia through which Paul passed, Acts 17:1, was a city of
   Macedonia, about 36 miles east of Thessalonica, and 30 miles south-west
   of Amphipolis. Lewin locates it at the modern Polina.","",1
317,Apollos,"APOL'LOS (belonging to Apollo), born at Alexandria, in Egypt, of Jewish
   parents, and described as an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures.
   Acts 18:24. As one of John's disciples he had been instructed in the
   elements of the Christian faith, but coming to Ephesus, a.d. 54, during
   the temporary absence of Paul, was more fully taught the doctrines of
   the gospel by Aquila and Priscilla, who had themselves been favored
   with the company and instruction of Paul at Corinth and on a voyage
   from that city to Ephesus. He afterward preached with abundant success
   in Achaia and at Corinth. Paul had already been instrumental in
   establishing a church there, to the care of which Apollos succeeded. 1
   Cor 3:6. The members of it were divided into parties, some being
   particularly partial to Paul, others to Apollos, and others still to
   Cephas or Peter. The rebuke of the apostle, 1 Cor 1:12, is directed
   against these partialities, in all which the power and grace of God
   seemed to be overlooked or disregarded. When Paul wrote his Epistle it
   is likely Apollos was either with him or near him, probably at Ephesus,
   a.d. 57. From 1 Cor 16:12 we learn that in consequence of these
   dissensions Apollos absolutely declined to go to Corinth. It has been
   remarked as an exemplary trait of character of these two eminent
   apostles that the contentions of their respective friends and admirers
   had no effect on their love and respect for each other. They both
   refrained from visiting the church while it was distracted with such
   prejudices and partialities, though a worldly ambition might have
   selected it as the field and the season of self-aggrandizement. Apollos
   is last mentioned Tit 3:13, and very affectionately. He was probably a
   more brilliant man than Paul. Some scholars consider him to have been
   the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. But this is a mere
   conjecture; no exact proof can be given.","",1
318,Apollyon,APOL'LYON. See Abaddon.,"",1
319,Apostle,"APOS'TLE (one sent forth). 1. This term was given originally to the
   twelve chief disciples of our Lord. Matt 10:2. Their names were Simon
   Peter, Andrew, James, and John (sons of Zebedee); Philip, Bartholomew,
   Thomas, Matthew, James, and Lebbeus, who is also called Judas or Jude
   (sons of Alpheus); Simon the Canaanaean (or Zealot) and Judas Iscariot.
   Christ's charge to them is recorded in Matt 10:5-42. All the known
   circumstances of their history will be found under their respective
   names.

   Speaking generally, the apostles were of the lower, but not the lowest,
   class of the people. They were all laymen. Their learning was rather of
   life than of books, and yet it is probable they possessed the rudiments
   of an education. Religious perceptions and piety they doubtless
   possessed. Yet they needed much instruction and a miraculous endowment
   before they were able to do the work of the gospel. The Acts of the
   Apostles tells us of their first independent labors. Paul was called as
   an apostle, 7 years after the resurrection of Christ, on the way to
   Damascus. He was not of the Twelve, but was of equal authority. Gal
   1:1, Jud 4:12, Ex 17:16; Gal 2:9.

   The office and commission of apostles were remarkable in the following
   particulars: (1.) They were all required to have been eye- and
   ear-witnesses of what they testified, especially of the resurrection of
   Christ. John 15:27; Acts 1:21, Josh 11:22 and Acts 22:14, 2 Sam 20:15;
   1 Cor 9:1 and 1 Cor 15:8; 1 John 1:3. (2.) They were all called or
   chosen by our Saviour himself. Luke 6:13; Gal 1:1. Even Matthias is not
   an exception to this remark, as the determination of the lot was of
   God. Acts 1:24-26. (3.) They were inspired. John 16:13. (4.) They had
   the power of miracles. Mark 16:20; Acts 2:43; Heb 2:4; Rom 15:18, Acts
   1:19; 2 Cor 12:12.

   The word ""apostle"" is also used in a wider sense of Christian heralds
   of the gospel. 2 Cor 8:23; Phil 2:25. (A. V. in both cases translates
   ""messenger."")
    1. The term apostle is also applied to our Saviour, Heb 3:1, and with
       singular propriety, as in the character of Messiah he is
       emphatically the Sent of God.","",1

323,Appeal,"APPEAL'. The right of appeal was acknowledged in the Jewish law. Deut
   17:8, Gal 1:9. For matters of controversy might be referred for final
   adjudication to ""the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that
   shall be in those days,"" in the place chosen of God. But this is not,
   properly speaking, such an appeal as our law recognizes. Yet we find
   traces of the principle in the days of the Judges, Jud 4:5, and of the
   kings. 2 Sam 15:3. Jehoshaphat established a permanent court before
   which all cases might come. 2 Chr 19:8. This court was re-established
   by Ezra. Ezr 7:25. The Sanhedrin in later times was the court of final
   appeal. By the Roman law every accused citizen had a right to carry his
   cause before the emperor at Rome, by appeal from the judgment of the
   magistrate. Acts 25:11.","",1

   so closely to Philemon, it has been reasonably conjectured that she was
   Philemon's wife.","",1
325,Appii forum,"AP'PII FO'RUM (market-place of Appius), a place on the famous Appian
   Way, 43 miles south-east of Rome, where the disciples met Paul. Acts
   28:15. It was at the end of a canal, and hence filled with taverns and
   boatmen. Its ruins are still seen near Treponti.","",1
326,Apples,"AP'PLES, AP'PLE - TREE (Hebrew, breathing forth). Song of Solomon
   2:3-5; Song of Solomon 7:8; Song of Solomon 8:5; Joel 1:12. Spoken of
   in the Scriptures as excellent ""among the trees of the wood,"" of
   pleasant shadow, with sweet, beautiful, and fragrant fruit. The Hebrew
   word, by its meaning, is thought to emphasize the latter property. The
   apple proper is rare in Syria, and its fruit is inferior. Writers have
   urged the citron, orange, quince, and apricot as the trees meant. The
   fruit of the latter two alone is specially aromatic, and of these the
   quince is not sweet in taste.

   The apricot is everywhere abundant in the Holy Land, and of it Tristram
   says: ""Many times have we pitched our tents in its shade and spread our
   carpets secure from the rays of the sun."" ""There can scarcely be a more
   deliciously-perfumed fruit than the apricot; and what fruit can better
   fit the epithet of Solomon, 'apples of gold in pictures of silver,'
   than this golden fruit as its branches bend under the weight in their
   setting of bright, yet pale, foliage?"" The expression of Solomon just
   referred to, Prov 25:11, is also supposed to compare fruit in silver
   baskets, or salvers curiously wrought like basket-work, and perhaps
   representing animals or landscapes, to seasonable advice wisely and
   courteously administered.

   Apple of the Eye (Hebrew, little man, or pupil of the eye). Prov 7:2;
   Zech 2:8. Apple here represents an entirely different word from the
   word of the preceding topic, meaning the front and most sensitive part
   of the organ of vision. The same figure is used, Deut 32:10 and Ps
   17:8, to denote the most complete protection and security. And in Lam
   2:18 the phrase ''apple of thine eye"" is figuratively used for tears.","",1
327,Aquila,"AQ'UILA. Acts 18:2. A Jew born at Pontus, in Asia Minor. Being driven
   from Rome by a decree of the government requiring all Jews to leave
   that city, he and his wife, Priscilla, came to Corinth, and were
   dwelling there at the time of Paul's first visit to that city. Acts
   18:1. They were of like occupation (tent-makers), and Paul was received
   and hospitably entertained at Aquila's house; and they also accompanied
   him from Corinth to Ephesus. On some occasion they rendered Paul very
   important service, and a very warm friendship existed between them. Rom

   whole land of Moab, Deut 2:29; burned by Sihon. Num 21:26-30. It has
   been placed at Rabbah or Rabbath, but good authorities regard it as a

   the home of the Arbite. [scripture]2 Sam. 23 35[scripture]. East of
   Hebron, at er-Rabiyeh, is an ancient site marked by walls, cisterns,
   and ruins, which Conder regards as the Arab of biblical history.","",1
331,Arabah,"AR'ABAH (burnt up), a word of frequent use in the Hebrew, though found
   only once in the English, version. Josh 18:18. It is the name applied
   to the deep sunken valley which extends from Mount Hermon to the
   Elamitic Gulf of the Red Sea. This remarkable depression is about 250
   miles long, and includes the Sea of Galilee and the Salt, or Dead, Sea,
   In some passages in Deuteronomy, the plain or ""the Arabah"" refers to
   the southern portion of the valley, between the Salt Sea and the Red
   Sea, Deut 1:1; Deut 2:8; in other passages the word doubtless refers to
   the northern portion of that valley along the Jordan, which the Arabs
   now call el-Ghor. See Jordan. Arabah is now applied only to that
   portion of the valley which stretches from the chalk-cliffs below the
   Dead Sea southward to the Gulf of Akabah-- Elanitic Gulf. It is about
   100 miles long and from 4 to 16 miles wide. The limestone walls on the
   west of the valley are from 1500 to 1800 feet in height; the
   mountain-wall on the east side of the valley rises from 2000 to 2300 in
   height, and in Mount Hor to 5000 feet, and is chiefly composed of
   granitic and basaltic rock. The surface of the valley is covered with
   loose gravel, blocks of porphyry, and is furrowed with torrents, with
   scarcely a trace of vegetation. It is oppressively hot, is swept with
   burning winds, the Sirocco blowing at some seasons without
   intermission, a region dreary and desolate. The theory that the Jordan
   once ran through this valley into the Red Sea is now held to be
   untenable. Arabah in Josh 18:18 has also been mistaken for the name of
   a city, and confounded with Beth-arabah of Josh 15:61; Josh 18:22; but
   in v. 1 Sam 30:18 the word has the article before it in the Hebrew, and
   hence refers to the plain, as elsewhere. See also Zin, Wilderness of,
   and Salt Sea.","",1
332,Arabia,"ARA'BIA (arid, sterile), a large peninsula in the south-western part of
   Asia, between the Red Sea, the Indian Ocean, and the Persian Gulf. Its
   extreme length from north to south is about 1300 miles, its greatest
   breadth about 1500 miles, though from the northern point of the Red Sea
   to the Persian Gulf is only about 900 miles. It has the sea on all
   sides except the north. Its area is estimated at 1,030,000 square
   miles; and of the three ancient divisions of the country, that known as
   Arabia Felix was by far the largest and most important, though it is
   less frequently mentioned by the sacred writers than either of the
   smaller and northern divisions.

   Sketch-Map of Arabia.

   Physical Features -- Its main features are a coast-range of low
   mountains or table-land, seldom rising over 2000 feet, broken on the
   eastern coast by sandy plains; this plateau is backed up by a second
   loftier range of mountains in the east and south. The mountains are
   generally barren on their sea side; their outlines are rugged and
   precipitous; behind the mountains encircling the sea-coast lies a ring
   of sterile desert, broadest in the east and south, where it is a waste
   of burning sand, narrower in the west and north, where it is rocky.
   Within this belt of desert rise tablelands broken by fertile valleys.
   This central plateau includes about one-third of the Arabian peninsula,
   the desert another third, and the coast-ranges the remaining portion.
   The Sinaitic peninsula is a small triangular region in the
   north-western part, or corner, of Arabia. See Sinai.

   Divisions of Arabia. -- The ancients divided it into Petroea, Deserta,
   and Felix; or the Stony, the Desert, and the Happy or Fertile. Modern
   geographers divide Arabia into a number of large districts, the chief
   of these being Yemen, which is the most fertile, and Hadramaut in the
   south, Oman in the east, Shomer and Sinai, or Negeb, in the north,
   Hedjaz, containing the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, in the west,
   and Nej'd in the central district. These districts are subdivided into
   upward of 35 smaller provinces. Some are thickly peopled with an
   agricultural population or those living in villages, while others are
   held by tribes of wandering Bedouins, each governed by the sheik.

   Productions. -- The principal animals are the horse, famed for its
   form, beauty, and endurance, camels, sheep, asses, dogs, the gazelle,
   tiger, lynx, and monkey, quails, peacocks, parrots, ostriches, vipers,
   scorpions, and locusts. Of fruits and grains, dates, wheat, millet,
   rice, beans, and pulse are common. It is also rich in minerals,
   especially in lead.

   Biblical History. -- Arabia in early Israelitish history meant a small
   tract of country south and east of Palestine, probably the same as that
   called Kedar, or ""the east."" Gen 10:30; Gen 26:6; Gen 29:1. Arabia in
   New Testament times appears to have been scarcely more extensive.Gal
   1:17; Gal 4:25. The chief inhabitants were known as Ishmaelites,
   Arabians, Idumeans, Horites, and Edomites. The allusions in the
   Scripture to the country and its people are very numerous. Job is
   supposed to have dwelt in Arabia. The forty years of wandering by the
   Israelites under Moses was in this land. See Sinai. Solomon received
   gold from it, 1 Kgs 10:15; 2 Chr 9:14; Jehoshaphat, flocks, 2 Chr
   17:11; some of its people were at Jerusalem at the Pentecost, Acts
   2:11; Paul visited it.Gal 1:17; the prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah
   frequently refer to it. Isa 21:11-13; Isa 42:11; Isa 60:7; Jer 25:24;
   Jer 49:28,1 Chr 2:29. See Kedar.

   Secular History. -- Arabia in earliest history was divided into several
   kingdoms, of which Yemen was the chief. In the fifth century the
   northern Arabs overran Yemen; later, in A. D. 529, came the great
   Abyssinian invasion; then the era of Mohammed, 622-632, followed by the
   conquests of his followers, who swept over Arabia, Palestine, Syria,
   and the whole of Western Asia, Northern Africa, and into Europe. In the
   next century their power in Arabia was broken and lost by dissensions,
   Arabia was disorganized, but rearranged in 929; furnished rulers for
   Egypt until 1171, in the time of Saladin; in 1517 the Turkish sultan,
   Selim I., was invested with the Mohammedan caliphate, and Arabia became
   subject to, and has since continued under, the Ottoman rule.","",1

   Sennacherib, 2 Kgs 19:37, margin; Isa 37:38, margin; (3) as a kingdom

   Ararat was a name unknown to Greek and Roman geographers, as it is now
   to the Armenian, but it was known to others in b. c. 1750 as the
   ancient name for a portion of Armenia. In Scripture it refers to the
   lofty plateau or mountain-highlands which overlook the plain of the
   Araxes. Various views have prevailed as to the Ararat on which the ark
   rested. Tradition identifies it with the mountain known as Ararat to
   Europeans, called ""Steep Mountain"" by the Turks, and Kah-i-Nah, or
   ""Noah's Mountain,"" by the Persians. It has two peaks, about 7 miles
   apart; the highest is 17,750 feet, the other about 4000 feet lower. The
   highest peak is covered with perpetual snow, and is a volcano, having
   had at least two violent eruptions within a century. The village of
   Arguri, built on its slopes, is said to be on the spot where tradition
   claims that Noah planted his vineyard. The mountains of Ararat, Gen
   8:4, more properly refer to the entire range of elevated table-land in
   that portion of Armenia, and upon some lower part of this range, rather
   than upon the high peaks before mentioned, the ark more probably
   rested. For (1) this plateau or range is about 6000 to 7000 feet high;
   (2) it is about equally distant from the Euxine and the Caspian Seas,
   and between the Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean, and hence a central
   point for the dispersion of the race; (3) the region is volcanic in its
   origin; it does not rise into sharp crests, but has broad plains
   separated by subordinate ranges of mountains; (4) the climate is
   temperate, grass and grain are abundant, the harvests quick to mature.
   All these facts illustrate the biblical narrative. George Smith,
   however, places Ararat in the southern part of the mountains east of
   Assyria (Chaldean Account of Genesis, p. 289).

   lived at Jerusalem and owned a threshing-place or floor, where the
   temple was afterward built. 2 Sam 24:16. David bought it of him because
   the destroying angel sent to desolate the nation, in consequence of
   David's sin of numbering the people, stayed his hand at the command of
   God just as he had reached the floor. Araunah refused at first to
   receive anything for it, but offered it to him, together with oxen for
   sacrifices, and the timber of the threshing-instruments for fuel. David
   refused to receive them as a gift, as he would not offer to the Lord
   that which had cost him nothing. He therefore bought the oxen for fifty
   shekels of silver, 2 Sam 24:24, and the whole place for six hundred
   shekels of gold, 1 Chr 21:25, and offered his sacrifices, which were
   accepted and the plague stayed. 2 Sam 24:23 may be better translated;
   ""The whole O king, does Araunah give unto the King."" But taking the
   Authorized Version translation as it stands, it favors the view of some
   that the expression ""Araunah the king"" implies that he was one of the

   Remains of Arch of Bridge between Zion and Moriah, and near the Jews'
   Wailing-place. (From Photograph.)

   The patriarchs, being nomads, lived in tents. During their sojourn in
   Egypt the Hebrews became acquainted with architecture as an art, and
   they were compelled by force to take part in the construction of huge
   monuments. Ex 1:11. Hence it was natural that their imagination should
   be deeply impressed by Egyptian architecture, and that they acquired
   some knowledge of the science on which it was based. But during their
   wanderings in the wilderness they had no opportunity to display it,
   except in the construction of the tabernacle; and at the conquest of
   Canaan they found forts and cities prepared by other hands. Jud
   1:16-26. It was not till the reigns of David and Solomon that Hebrew
   architecture suddenly started into existence. The influence from Egypt
   at once made it self felt. David enlarged Jerusalem, improved its
   fortifications, and built a palace on Mount Zion, perhaps also the
   original walls of the great mosque at Hebron. Solomon built another
   palace, ""the house of the forest of Lebanon,"" a palace for his wife,
   the daughter of Pharaoh, gigantic water-works south of Bethlehem, still
   known under the name of ""Solomon's Pools,"" and finally the greatest,
   and we may say the only great, monument of Hebrew architecture, the
   temple. These buildings were, to a large extent, erected by Phoenician
   workmen, 2 Sam 5:6-11, and we may easily believe that Phoenician taste
   has made itself felt in many details. But so far as it is possible to
   reconstruct the temple after the descriptions given of it in the Bible,
   it must as a whole have reminded the spectator of Egyptian
   architecture. The remains of an arch of the bridge between Zion and
   Moriah, and the remnants of the old wall, called the ""Wailing-place of
   the Jews,"" show the massiveness of the old Hebrew structures; and from
   the descriptions it is apparent that everywhere in these buildings, the
   temple as well as the palaces, the straight line and the right angle
   were predominant. But massiveness of construction and straightness of
   form are two of the most prominent features of Egyptian architecture.

   The successors of David and Solomon continued to build, and several
   kings of both Israel and Judah are mentioned as having encouraged
   architecture. Nor did the nation as a whole forget the art. After the
   return from Babylon the Jews were able to fortify Jerusalem and rebuild
   their temple themselves. Ezr 3:8-10; Ezr 6:14; Neh 3; Neh 6:15. Herod
   the Great was a great builder, and introduced the Greek and Roman
   styles of architecture. The temple reconstructed by him before and
   during the life of our Lord was totally destroyed in a.d. 70. For
   further details see Temple; for details concerning the Jewish
   architecture, see Dwelling.","",1

   upon Antipas and routed him. The emperor Tiberius then despatched the
   governor of Syria to the assistance of Antipas, with orders to bring
   the Arabian to Rome alive, or if dead to send his head. While on the
   march against him Vitellius learned that Tiberius was dead, a.d. 37. He
   then dismissed his troops. Antipas was soon after banished and his-
   kingdom given to Agrippa. It is likely that Aretas was restored to the
   good graces of the Romans, and that Caligula granted him Damascus,

   2. Moses' ark of bulrushes. Ex 2:3. 3. And usually, the ark of the
   covenant.
    1. Noah's Ark. -- It was four hundred and fifty feet long,
       seventy-five feet in breadth, and forty-five in height, and was
       designed, not to sail, but only to float when borne up by the
       waters. It had lower, second, and third stories, besides what in
       common vessels is called the hold. A door was placed in the side,
       and on the roof a series of windows or a window-course in which
       some translucent substance may have been used.

   The ark was constructed of gopherwood, and covered with bitumen or
   pitch to exclude water.

   It is doubtful where the ark was built and as to how long time it took.
   The weight of opinion is that it was from one hundred to one hundred
   and twenty years. Compare Gen 5:32 and 1 Tim 7:6; Gen 6:3 with 1 Pet
   3:20.

   The ark is supposed to have been a long, square-cornered boat with a
   flat bottom and a sloping roof; and the construction of it has been the
   subject of much curious, not to say useless, speculation. The
   proportions of the ark, as those recommended by the experience of
   centuries of ship-building, are of themselves a proof of Noah's
   inspiration. In regard to the capacity of the ark, it was large enough
   to accommodate the eight persons of Noah's family, and all the animals
   to be saved in it. Some scholars confine the number of animals to the
   species living in the parts of the world then inhabited by men,
   excepting, of course, such as live in the water or lie dormant.
   Traditions of the ark and of the Deluge are found among most ancient
   nations. See Flood.
    1. Moses's Ark was made of the bulrush or papyrus, which grows in
       marshy places in Egypt. It was daubed with slime, which was
       probably the mud of which their bricks were made, and with pitch or
       bitumen. Ex 2:3.
    2. Ark of the Covenant, Ex 25:10, a chest constructed by the express
       command of Jehovah, three feet nine inches in length, and two feet
       three inches in width and height, made of shittim-wood and covered
       with plates of gold within and without. A border or crown of gold
       encircled it near the top, and it was surmounted by the

   Supposed form of Ark of the Covenant.

   mercy-seat, which was of solid gold, and answered the purpose of a
   cover or lid to the ark. On each end of the mercy-seat was placed a
   golden image representing a cherub facing inward and bending down over
   the ark. Two rings of gold were attached to the body of the ark on each
   side, through which passed the staves or poles, made of the same wood
   and overlaid with gold, that were used in carrying it from place to
   place, and these were never taken out. This ark contained originally
   and in design, 1. A golden pot in which the three quarts of manna were
   preserved. Ex 16:33. 2. Aaron's rod, which at different places
   miraculously budded and blossomed and yielded fruit all at once, Num
   17:8; and, 3. The tables of the testimony, or the tables of the ten
   commandments, written with the finger of God and constituting the
   testimony or evidence of the covenant between God and the people. Deut
   31:26; Heb 9:3, 4. Hence it is sometimes called the ark of the
   testimony, and sometimes the ark of the covenant. Ex 25:16 and Ex
   40:21; It is probable that the first two were hopelessly lost before
   the reign of Solomon. 1 Kgs 8:9. On the mercy-seat which surmounted the
   ark rested the awful and mysterious symbol of the divine presence. Lev
   16:2; Num 7:89. When the Israelites were journeying through the
   wilderness, the ark was borne in advance of the people, and their route
   was providentially indicated by ""the cloud of the Lord."" When the ark
   set forward, Moses said, ""Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be
   scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee."" Num 10:33-36.

   After the children of Israel had passed the Jordan, whose waters
   divided at the approach of the ark. Josh 3:14-17, the tabernacle was
   set up at Gilgal, and this sacred vessel remained in it for a season.
   It was then removed to Shiloh, where it was stationary between three
   and four hundred years, [scripture]Jer. 7:12-15[scripture]; and being
   then taken out and borne before the army, it fell into the hands of the
   Philistines at the defeat of the Israelites near Aphek. 1 Sam 4. The
   Philistines took it to Ashdod and placed it by the side of their
   idolgod Dagon, 1 Sam 5; but by severe judgments God avenged his
   insulted majesty, and they were compelled to return the ark to the
   people of Israel, by whom it was lodged at Kirjath-jearim. 1 Sam 6 and
   1 Kgs 15:7. When David had fixed his residence at Jerusalem, the ark
   was removed thither with sacred ceremonies, and kept until the temple
   was prepared to receive it. 2 Sam 6; 1 Chr 15:25-28, on which occasion
   it is supposed the one hundred and thirty-second Psalm was written.
   Solomon put it in the temple. 2 Chr 5:2-10. Manasseh placed a carved
   image in the house of God, probably removing the ark to make way for
   it. Josiah, however, restored it. See 2 Chr 33:7 and 2 Chr 35:3.

   The second temple did not contain the ark; whether it was seized among
   the spoils when the city was sacked, or whether it was secreted and
   afterward destroyed, does not appear. The Jews think it will be

   in western Asia, between the Caspian and the Black Seas, and the
   Caucasus and Taurus ranges of mountains.

   Physical Features. -- It is chiefly an elevated plateau, about 7000
   feet above the level of the sea, the highest peak being Ararat, the
   lower portions of the plateau being broken by valleys and glens,
   including the fertile valleys of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers. It is
   watered by four large streams, the Aras, the Kur, the Euphrates, and
   the Tigris, and also by numerous lakes, one of the largest, the salt
   Lake Van, being over 5400 feet above the sea. Its three mountain-ranges
   abound in volcanic rocks, in lead, copper, iron, silver, rock-salt, and
   mineral springs. The climate is cold in the highlands, while the heat
   of summer is intense in the valleys.

   History. -- Three districts probably included in Armenia are mentioned
   in the Bible, Ararat, Minni and Ashchenaz. and Togarmah. (1) Ararat was
   a central region near the range of mountains of the same name. (2 )
   Minni and Aschenaz, Jer 51:27, districts in the upper valley of a
   branch of the Euphrates. (3) Togarmah, Eze 27:14; Eze 38:6, was
   apparently the name by which the most, or perhaps the whole, of the
   land was known to the Hebrews. Armenian tradition claims that Armenia
   was settled by Haik, a grandson of Japhet, about b.c. 2200, The land
   soon became tributary to Assyria, and so continued until the eighth
   century b. c.; was again independent until b.c. 325; subject to
   Macedonia for 130 years; again free until b.c. 34; since then
   alternately overrun by Romans, Persians, Greeks, Kurds, and Turks, and
   divided between Russia, Turkey, and Persia. The people have long been
   nominally Christian. Religious persecution and war have driven great
   numbers of Armenians from their native land into Asia Minor and Europe.
   The present number of Armenians is estimated to be from 2,500,000 to
   3,000,000, of whom about 1,000,000 live in Armenia. Its chief modern

       usually made of light wood and covered with several folds or
       thicknesses of stout hide, which were preserved and polished by
       frequent applications of oil, Isa 21:5, and often painted with
       circles of various colors or figures. Nah 2:3. Sometimes osiers, or
       reeds woven like basket-work, were used to stretch the hide upon,
       and sometimes the shield was made either entirely of brass or gold,
       or covered with thick plates of

   those metals. 1 Kgs 14:26, 2 Chr 11:21. It was of various forms, but
   generally circular or oblong. The shield was held by the

   left arm. The hand passed through under two straps or thongs placed
   thus, X. and grasped with the fingers another small strap near the edge
   of the shield, so that it was held with great firmness. A single handle
   of wood or leather in the centre was used in later times. The outer
   surface was made more or less rounding from the centre to the edge, and
   being polished smooth made the arrows or darts glance off or rebound
   with increased force; and the edges were armed with plates of iron, not
   only to strengthen them, but to preserve the perishable part from the
   dampness while lying upon the ground. In times of peace the shield was
   kept in a covering. In times of engagement the shields were either held
   above the head or they were placed together edge to edge, and thus
   formed a continuous barrier.
    1. The target was a long shield, protecting the whole body, larger
       than the bucklers above described. 1 Kgs 10:16, 2 Sam 21:17. It is
       usually mentioned in connection with heavy arms, while the shield
       is spoken of with the sword, dart, and other light arms. It
       probably resembled the great shield of the Romans, which in some
       cases was four feet high and two and a half feet broad, and so
       curved as to fit the body of the soldier.
    2. The coat of mail of Goliath, 1 Sam 17:5, covered the body upon and
       below the breast and back, and was probably like a shirt covered
       with rows of brass pieces overlapping one another; and this may
       have been the usual form. The habergeon of Neh 4:16 is a different
       translation of the same word. The article so called formed part of
       the high priest's dress, and ""is supposed to have been of linen,
       thickly woven or quilted, with a binding on the neck, and plated on
       the breast with mail.""
    3. Greaves or boots, 1 Sam 17:6, were for the protection of the legs,
       being made of brass and fastened by leather thongs over the shins.
       They are mentioned only as a part of the armor of Goliath, and
       probably were not in common use among the Hebrews, though they were
       almost universal among the Greeks and Romans.
    4. Helmet. This was a cap, the diverse shapes of which are seen in the
       figures of the archers, slinger, bearers of shields. In early times
       skins of the heads of animals were used, but afterward it was made
       of thick, tough hide, and sometimes of plated brass, 1 Sam 17:38,
       and usually crowned with a crest or plume as an ornament.

   Armor-bearer. Jud 9:54. An officer selected by kings and generals from
   the bravest of their favorites, whose service

   Egyptian Battle-axes. (From Rosellini and Chattipollion.)

   it was, not only to bear their armor, but to stand by them in danger
   and carry their orders, somewhat after the manner of adjutants in
   modern service. 1 Sam 16:21 and 1 Sam 31:4.

    1. Egyptian Maces and Clubs.
    2. Assyrian Maces.

   ARMS were weapons or instruments of offence. They were the sword, the
   spear or javelin, dart or lance, the bow

   Assyrian Swords or Daggers. (From Nineveh Marbles.)

   and arrow, the sling, the quiver, and the battle-axe.
    1. The sword. Gen 27:40. This was a short two-edged instrument
       resembling what we call a dagger. It was carried in a sheath or
       scabbard, Jer 47:6; Eze 21:9, 1 Kgs 20:30, and suspended to the
       girdle or belt. Jud 3:16; 2 Sam 20:8.

   Assyrian Spears and Shields. (From Nineveh Marbles.)
    1. Of the spear there were at least three distinct varieties, which
       differed chiefly in length and size. (1.) The spear,

   Assyrian Archers behind a large Shield. (From Nineveh Marbles.)

   par-excellence, was a long wooden staff with a stout metal point at one
   end. The Greek spears were sometimes twenty-five feet long, and the
   Arabs now use them fifteen feet long. They were required to be long
   enough to reach beyond the front rank when used by those who were in
   the second rank. Goliath's spear was said to have a staff ""like a
   weaver's beam."" 1 Sam 17:7. This largest sort of spear was used by Saul
   habitually. It must have had a metallic point at its butt end, because
   it was stuck into the ground, 1 Sam 26:1, and Asahel was killed ""with
   the hinder end"" of Abner's spear. 2 Sam 2:23. It was this kind of
   spear, and not a ""javelin,"" which Saul threw at David and Jonathan. 1
   Sam 18:11; 1 Sam 20:33. There was a somewhat lighter spear, which was
   carried on the back when not in use. 1 Sam 17:6. (Authorized Version
   translates target.) (2.) The javelin was a short spear, cast,as is
   supposed, with the hand. Num 25:7. (3.) The dart was still smaller than
   the javelin, and used in like manner. 2 Chron 32:5.
    1. The arrow was a slender missile shot from a bow, as in modern days.
       1 Sam 20:36. It was used in hunting. Gen 27:3, as well as in
       combat. Gen 48:22. Those who used the bow were called ""archers.""
       Gen 21:20. Arrows were originally made of reeds, and afterward of
       any light wood. The bows were made of flexible wood or steel, Ps
       18:34, and the bowstring of leather, horsehair, or the tendons of
       animals. Bows were the chief dependence in both an attack and a
       defence. The point of the arrow was barbed like a fish-hook. Ps
       38:2.

   Egyptian Archer. (Eosellini.)

   Job refers to the use of poisoned arrows. Job 6:4, and fire was often
   conveyed by the use of juniper-wood, which kindled upon the combustible
   baggage or armament of the enemy. Ps 91:5; Ps 120:4. It is said that
   the coals of the

   Assyrian and Egyptian Quivers and Bows.

   juniper-wood retain their heat for a long time. The Phoenicians and, in
   later times, the Spaniards have used arrows for the like purpose.
   Arrows were used in divination. Eze 21:21.

   Arrows were kept in a case or box called a quiver, which was slung over
   the shoulder in such a position that the soldier could draw out the
   arrows when wanted. The position of the quiver and bow is seen in a
   preceding cut. The drawing of the bow was a test of strength, and is
   still so among the Arabians. Hence the allusion in Ps 18:34.
    1. The sling, 1 Sam 17:40, was an early weapon of war, by which stones
       were thrown with great force and surprising accuracy of aim. This
       skill was shown in a remarkable degree by the Benjamites, who could
       employ the left hand in its use with great adroitness. Jud 20:16.
       The slingers

   ranked next to the archers in efficiency, and formed a regular arm of
   the service.

   Assyrian Slinger.
    1. The battle-axe, Jer 51:20, was obviously a powerful weapon of war,
       but of its ancient form and manner of use we have now no knowledge.

   The term ""armor,"" and the various offensive and defensive articles
   comprised in it, are frequently used figuratively in the Bible, in Eph
   6:11-17, where the graces of the Christian character are represented as
   the armor of God, in which he clothes the believer, and by which he is
   enabled to fight the good fight of faith with a victorious arm.","",1
374,Army,"AR'MY The armies of the Israelites embraced the whole male population
   of the country of twenty years and over, Num 1:2,Num 1:3, Num 26:2, and
   when occasion required, the entire body was readily mustered. Jud
   20:1-11; 1 Sam 11:7, 1 Kgs 15:8. This accounts for the prodigious
   numbers which were often assembled. 2 Chron 13:3; 2 Chron 14:9. See
   War. The system was minute. Each tribe constituted a division with a
   separate banner and separate position on the march to the Holy Land,
   and as near as possible in battle. The army gathered from the tribes
   was divided into thousands and hundreds under their respective
   captains. Num 31:14. The kings had body-guards. 1 Sam 13:2; 1 Sam
   25:13. In later times a standing army was maintained, and in war troops
   were sometimes hired. 2 Chr 25:6. But ordinarily the soldiers received
   no wages, but were armed and supported. 1 Kgs 4:27; 1 Kgs 10:26. Hence
   their campaigns were short, and generally terminated by a single
   battle. Horses were not used, it is supposed, until Solomon's time. The
   manner of declaring war, and the character and occupation of exempts,
   are minutely stated. Deut 20:1-14;Deut 24:5.","",1
375,Arnon,"AR'NON (noisy), a stream running into the Dead Sea from the east, and
   which divided Moab from the Ambrites. Num 21:13; Jud 11:18. The Arnon
   is about 50 miles long; 90 feet wide, and from 4 to 10 feet deep at its
   mouth; full in winter, but nearly dry in summer; had several fords, Isa
   16:2, and ""high places,"" Num 21:28; Isa 15:2; is referred to 24 times
   in the Bible. Its modern name is el-Mejib. It runs through a deep
   ravine with precipitous limestone cliffs on either side, in some places
   over 2000 feet high. Ruins of forts, bridges, and buildings abound on
   its banks, and fish in its waters; oleanders and almond trees bloom in

   522, and was murdered after 8 months.

       generally regarded as the same with Artaxerxes Longimanus (i.e. the
       Long-handed), son of Xerxes, who reigned b. c. 464--425. In the
       seventh year of his reign he permitted Ezra to return into Judaea,

389,Asa,"A'SA (physician) was son and successor of Abijam on the throne of
   Judah, b. c. 955-914. 1 Kgs 15:8. He reigned forty-one years. Though
   educated in the principles of a false religion, he showed from the
   first his decided opposition to idolatry, and even deposed his
   grandmother, Maachah, because she had made an idol in a grove. The
   first part of his reign was peaceful, and he improved the opportunity
   to purify his kingdom from idolatry and to build and fortify several
   cities; and when Zerah, an Ethiopian king, invaded his territories with
   an army of a million of men and three hundred chariots, Asa met him at
   Mareshah with 580,000 men, and defeated him. This battle was one of the
   most important in Jewish history. 2 Chr 14.

   At the suggestion of the prophet Azariah, Asa set about the reformation
   of every abuse in his kingdom, and appointed a solemn festival of
   thanksgiving to God, at which all the people were assembled, and
   entered into a formal covenant with God. Baasha, king of Israel,
   finding his subjects too much disposed to go into Judah and dwell
   there, commenced fortifying Ramah, a place near the frontiers of both
   kingdoms, with a view to cut off the passage of emigrants to Jerusalem
   and other parts of Judah. Asa, though he had so long enjoyed the favor
   and protection of God, was now tempted to forsake him. Instead of
   trusting him for deliverance, as he had done in years past, he sent to
   Ben-hadad, the king of Syria, and prevailed on him, even in violation
   of a treaty which existed between Ben-hadad and Baasha, to come to the
   help of Judah against Israel. The Syrian king, won by the presents
   which Asa had sent him, immediately attacked and destroyed several
   important cities of Israel. Baasha, finding his kingdom thus invaded,
   abandoned the fortification of Ramah that he might protect the
   provinces of the interior from desolation. Asa seized the opportunity
   to demolish Ramah and take away the stone and timber which were
   collected there and use them in the building of his own cities. In the
   mean time, Hanani the prophet was sent to rebuke him for forsaking
   Jehovah, and to announce his punishment. But Asa was enraged by the
   faithful message, and caused the bearer of it to be imprisoned. 2 Chr
   16:10. In the latter part of his life Asa had a disease of the feet,
   perhaps the gout, but ""he sought not to the Lord, but to the
   physicians."" We may, however, accept his sufferings as an extenuating
   circumstance for his occasional acts of tyranny. He died b. c. 914, in
   the forty-first year of his reign, and was buried with great pomp. 2

    1. (Ashtoreth, sing.; Ashtaroth, plur. and more usual.) An idol,
       represented in the subjoined cut, Jud 2:13; called the goddess of
       the Sidonians. It was much worshipped in Syria and Phoenicia.
       Solomon introduced the worship of it. 1 Kgs 11:33. The Greeks and
       Romans called it Astarte. The four hundred priests of Jezebel,
       mentioned 1 Kgs 18:19, are supposed to have been employed in the
       service of this idol; and we are told that under this name

   Figure of Astarte. (Rawlinson's ""Herodotus."")

   three hundred priests were constantly employed in its service at
   Hierapolis, in Syria, many centuries after Jezebel's time. - The
   worship of Ashtoreth was suppressed by Josiah. It was simply
   licentiousness under the guise of religion. The goddess was called the
   ""queen of heaven,"" and the worship was said to be paid to the ''host of
   heaven."" It is usually mentioned in connection with Baal. Baal and
   Ashtoreth are taken by many scholars as standing for the sun and the
   moon respectively; by others as representing the male and female powers
   of reproduction. Asherah, which is translated in the Authorized Version

429,Ass,"ASS. Gen 22:3. This animal is among the most common mentioned in
   Scripture, and constituted a considerable part of the wealth of ancient
   times. Gen 12:16 and Gen 30:43; Job 1:3; Job 42:12. Asses were
   sometimes so numerous as to require a special keeper. Gen 36:24; 1 Chr
   27:30. The ass and the ox were the principal animals of burden and
   draught. Ex 23:12. The domestic ass is indeed a most serviceable
   animal, and in some respects preferable to the horse. He subsists on
   very coarse food and submits to the meanest drudgery. His skin is
   remarkably thick, and is used at this day for parchment, drumheads,
   memorandum-books, etc. The usual color of asses is red or dark brown,
   but sometimes they are of a silver white, and these last were usually
   appropriated to persons of dignity. Jud 5:10. So in Gen 49:11 the
   allusion to the ass and the vine imports dignity and fruitfulness, and
   the continuance and increase of both in the tribe of Judah. There was a
   breed of asses far superior to those that were used in labor, and which
   are supposed to be referred to in most of the passages above cited.

   The female, or she-ass, was particularly valuable for the saddle and
   for her milk, which was extensively used for food and for medicinal
   purposes. The ass was used in agricultural labor, especially in earing
   (ploughing) the ground and treading it to prepare it for the seed. Isa
   30:24 and Isa 32:20. The prohibition, Deut 22:10, might have been
   founded in part on the inequality of strength between the ox and the
   ass, and the cruelty of putting upon them the same burden, but was
   intended chiefly to mark the separation of the Jews from surrounding
   nations, among whom such a union of different beasts was not uncommon.
   So serviceable, and indeed essential, to man was this animal in ancient
   times that to drive away the ass of the fatherless is reckoned among
   the most atrocious acts

   The Eastern Ass (After Wood. ""Animal Kingdom."")

   of oppression and cruelty. Job 24:3, as depriving an orphan family of
   their only cow would be regarded at the present day. The attachment of
   this animal to its owner is among its remarkable characteristics. In
   this respect it closely resembles the dog. Hence the severity of the
   prophet's rebuke. Isa 1:3.

   The fact stated in 2 Kgs 6:25 shows that such was the extremity of the
   famine that the people were willing to give an exorbitant price for the
   head of an ""unclean"" animal.

   The ass, when dead, was thrown into an open field, and that part of his
   flesh which was not consumed by beasts and birds was suffered to
   putrefy and decay. Nothing could be more disgraceful than to expose a
   human body in the like manner. Jer 22:19; Jer 36:30.

   Our Saviour's entrance into Jerusalem riding upon an ass's colt
   fulfilled the prophecy in Zech 9:9. It is not considered in the East
   less honorable to ride this animal than a horse. But the latter is
   chiefly used for warlike purposes, as the ass is not. This peaceful
   animal was appropriated to the Prince of peace, who came not as other
   conquerors.

   The Arabian ass has a light, quick step. In Persia, Syria, and Egypt
   ladles are accustomed to ride on asses, and they are particularly
   valuable in mountainous countries, being more surefooted than horses.
   Their ordinary gait is four miles an hour.

   The ass in its wild or natural state is a beautiful animal. It is often
   alluded to in the sacred writings. Job 11:12; Deut 24:5 and Job 39:5-8.
   Asses usually roamed in herds through barren and desolate districts.
   Isa 32:14;Hos 8:9. One was recently taken in a pitfall in Astrachan,
   and added to the Surrey zoological collection in England. It is
   described as having a deer-like appearance, standing high on the legs,
   very active, of a silvery color, with a dark brown streak along the
   back.","",1

437,Assyria,"ASSYR'IA, a great empire of Western Asia, founded by Asshur, Gen
   10:10-11, who built Nineveh, Rehoboth (?), Calah, and Resen. Assyria
   proper appears to have included about the same territory as modern
   Kurdistan. The empire covered at times a far larger extent of
   territory, and in its prosperity nearly all of western Asia and
   portions of Africa were subject to its power.

   Physical Features. -- The chief rivers of Assyria were the Euphrates
   and Tigris. The country was well watered. On the east and north were
   ranges of mountains, the highest covered with snow. The central
   portions were along the fertile valleys of the two great rivers. There
   are immense level tracts of the country, now almost a wilderness, which
   bear marks of having been cultivated and thickly populated in early
   times. Among its products, besides the common cereals, were dates,
   olives, cotton, mulberries, gum-arabic, madder, and castor-oil. Of
   animals, the bear, deer, wolf, lynx, hyena, antelope, lion, tiger,
   beaver, and camel were common. The fertility of the country is
   frequently noted by ancient writers.

   Biblical History. -- Assyria is among the earliest countries mentioned
   in the Bible, Gen 2:14, and is referred to about one hundred and twenty
   times in the Old Testament, though only four or five of its kings are
   noticed by name. Scripture, tradition, and the monuments of the country
   unite in testifying that Assyria was peopled from Babylon. Gen
   10:10-11. From the time of Nimrod until two centuries after the
   division of the Israelitish kingdom the Scriptures make no mention of
   Assyria. During the rule of Menahem, Pul, the king of Assyria, invaded
   Israel and levied a heavy tribute upon it, 2 Kgs 15:19; a few years
   later, when Pekah was king of Israel, and Ahaz, king of Judah,
   Tiglath-pileser, another king of Assyria, aided Judah in a war against
   Israel and Syria. 2 Kgs 16:7-9; 2 Kgs 15:29; 2 Chr 28:6. In the reign
   of Hoshea the Assyrians under Shalmaneser again invaded Israel, and
   after besieging its capital, Samaria, for three years, captured it,
   destroyed the kingdom, and carried the people into captivity, b.c. 721,
   and repeopled the land by colonies from Babylon, Cuthah, and Hamath. 2
   Kgs 17:1-6, Jud 6:24 Sargon, a usurper and great warrior, succeeded
   Shalmaneser as king of Assyria, and perhaps completed the conquest of
   Samaria and of Israel undertaken by his predecessor. Sargon deposed
   Merodach Baladan, king of Babylon, made an expedition against Egypt,
   when he captured Ashdod, Isa 20:1-4, conquered Syria, and subdued a
   large portion of western Asia. Under Sargon, Nineveh, the capital of
   the empire, was repaired and adorned with a royal palace and many
   magnificent buildings. See illustration on p. 80. He was succeeded by
   his son, Sennacherib, about b. c. 704, who became the most celebrated
   of all the Assyrian kings. During his reign of 22 years he crushed the
   revolt of Berodach Baladan, and drove him from the country; carried his
   conquests into Egypt, Philistia, Armenia, Media, and Edom. He invaded
   the kingdom of Judah in the reign of Hezekiah, and his army was
   miraculously destroyed, and he returned home in shame, and was slain by
   his two sons. 2 Chr 32:1-21; 2 Kgs 19:35-37. He was succeeded by
   Esarhaddon, who reigned 13 years, and was succeeded by Assur-banipal
   (Sardanapalus), a noted warrior and builder, who extended the limits of
   the empire and erected a grand palace at Konyunjik. After his reign the
   empire began gradually to decline, until in b.c. 625 (some say 606) it
   was subdued by the Medes and Babylonians, and the latter became the
   dominant power during the great Captivity. 2 Kgs 24:1; 2 Kgs 25:1-8;
   Dan 1:1;Dan 3:1; Jud 5:1;Eze 29:18. See Nineveh and Babylon.

   Art, Language, and Religion. -- The artistic skill, genius, and
   magnificence displayed by the Assyrians in architecture and in the
   arts, as shown bv the exhumed remains of their great cities, are the
   admiration of scholars. The massive walls and towers which surrounded
   their towns; the vastness and beauty of their ruined palaces at
   Khorsabad and Koniyunjik; the elaborate finish and adornments of their
   temples and other edifices at Nimroud and Kileh Sherghat; the
   sculptures in marble, stone, bronze, and clay; the remarkable specimens
   of transparent glass vases; the tables, chairs, and articles of luxury
   for the home; their chariots and implements of war, -- are the wonder
   of explorers of our day. Canon Rawlinson declares the much lauded
   Egyptians to be very decidedly the inferiors of the Assyrians,
   excepting in the one point of the grandeur and durability of their
   architecture. The language of Assyria was Semitic, and in style
   derived, according to Rawlinson, from the Chaldaean, but of a less
   archaic type. It was written without pictorial representations of
   objects, and in the arrow-headed or wedge-shaped characters, of which
   over 300 different signs or characters are now known to have been used
   in the Assyrian alphabet. ""Their language and alphabet are confessedly
   in advance of the Egyptian."" -- Rawlinson's Five Ancient Monarchies,
   1870, i. p. 247. Of their religion the same author says it is ""more
   earnest and less degrading than that of Egypt. Idols and idol-worship
   prevailed. Of eleven chief gods and an equal number of goddesses, the
   greatest was Asshur, one of whose symbols was a winged sphere with the
   figure of a man armed with a bow issuing from the centre. Among the
   other gods were Bel, Sin the moon-god, Shamas the sun-god, Ishtar, and
   Nebo. Their idols were of stone and clay, and were worshipped with
   sacrifices, libations, and offerings, and by fastings of man and beast.
   The tablets testify to the attention given to religion by the learned,
   and the records and sculptures indicate the general spirit of worship
   prevailing among the people, while it also shows their gross idolatry.""

   Modern Discoveries and General History. -- Concerning the history of
   the Assyrian kingdom and empire, comparatively little was known
   previous to recent discoveries. The researches of

   Assyrian Palace Restored. (After Ferguson.) Botta, 1842-1850; Layard,
   1851-1853; Sir H. Rawlinson, 1850-1867; Oppert, 1857-1870; Lenormant,
   1868-1873; George Smith, 1872-1877; and those of Rassam, 1878, -- have
   rescued the annals of that country from obscurity, and furnished the
   materials for a trustworthy history. These records, together with the
   vast buildings, monuments, and grand palaces, were buried many feet
   beneath mounds of earth, and their existence for hundreds of years was
   wholly unknown to the world. By patient excavation the monuments,

   temples, palaces, and other evidences of Assyrian greatness have been
   brought to light within the past forty years; even large portions of
   the vast libraries of her kings have been discovered, the unknown
   characters in which they were written have been deciphered, and the
   inscriptions and records translated into modern languages, not only
   giving a history of the exploits of this remarkable nation, but also
   throwing much light on its customs, religious life, and language, and
   upon the many Scripture references to Assyria.

   A vast mass of documents has been dug up from the mounds, written in
   cuneiform or wedge-shaped characters and in the Assyrian tongue. The
   inscriptions were upon slabs of stone, which formed the panels of the
   palace walls, on obelisks of stone, on clay tablets, and on cylinders
   or hexagonal prisms of terra cotta two or three feet long. These
   tablets and cylinders were undoubtedly a part of the royal library in
   the days of Tiglath-pileser and of other noted kings.

   ""The Assyrian power was a single monarchy from the beginning, and
   gradually grew by conquering the smaller states around it; and there is
   consequently a uniformity in its records and traditions which makes
   them easier to follow than those of the sister kingdom."" -- George
   Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, 1875, p. 447. A list of 50 Assyrian kings
   who reigned from b.c. 1850 to b.c. 607 has been compiled from the royal
   tablets by George Smith. Of these kings, twenty eight reigned previous
   to Tiglath-pileser I., b.c. 1120; fifteen reigned from Tiglath-pileser
   I. to Tiglath-pileser II., b.c. 745; and after his time reigned the
   following seven, four of whom are certainly mentioned in Scripture
   history: Shalmaneser IV., Sargon, Sennacherib, Esarhaddon,
   Assur-banipal, Bel-zakir-iskun, and Assur-ebil-ili. The first capital
   of Assyria was Asshur, on the Tigris, about 60 miles south of Nineveh;
   its second capital, founded or more probably rebuilt and enlarged by
   Shalmaneser I., was Calah or Halah. As Assyrian conquests extended
   north and east, the capital was removed to Nineveh, which became a vast
   city, and according to Layard covered the present site of Konyunjik,
   Nimrud, Khorsabad, and Karamles. This space would correspond to the
   measurements of the city given by Diodorus. -- Layard: Nineveh, 1849,
   vol. ii. pp. 243-247. In his view, Nimrud was the original site of
   Nineveh, whose founder built a new city at Kileh Sherghat. In later
   periods palaces were built at Khorsabad, Karamles, and the largest of
   all these structures at Konyunjik. About 630 b.c. the Medes from the
   north and the Susianians from the south invaded Assyria; after a brief
   contest they conquered it, and the empire was divided between the
   conquerors. The kingdom of Assyria extended over a period of 1200
   years, though the empire can only at the utmost be considered to have
   lasted six and a half centuries, and its ascendency in western Asia not
   more than 500 years, b.c. 1125-625. Of the importance of the recent
   discoveries it is said, ""Every spadeful of earth which was removed from
   those vast remains tended to confirm the truth of prophecy and to
   illustrate Scripture. But who could have believed that records
   themselves should have been found which, as to their minuteness of
   details and the wonderful accuracy of their statements, should confirm,
   almost word for word, the very text of Scripture? And remember that
   these were no fabrications of a later date, on monuments centuries
   after the deeds which they professed to relate had taken place, but
   records engraved by those who had actually taken part in the events.""

451,Athens,"ATH'ENS, the name of several places, but chiefly of the capital of

   goddess Minerva or Athene. For sketch map see Corinth.

   Situation. -- It was situated about 5 miles north-east of the Saronic
   Gulf, in the plain of Attica, the south-eastern portion of the Grecian
   peninsula, between the little rivers Cephissus and Ilissus. The port,
   Piraeus, is five miles off, and now connected with the city by a
   railroad. About the plain, on the northwest, the north-east, the
   south-east, and south-west, were four noted mounts. Within the city
   were four more noted hills -- the Acropolis, Areopagus or Mars' Hill,
   the Pnyx, and the Museum. The Acropolis is about 150 feet high, with a
   flat top about 1100 feet long by 450 feet wide, having a steep ascent
   on all sides. West of the Acropolis is Mars' Hill, of irregular form,
   and on which public assemblies and the chief courts were held. Upon
   this hill Paul preached. Acts 17:19, Josh 11:22. Beneath it are the
   Caves of the Furies.

   History. -- Athens was first settled by some chieftain, perhaps
   Cecrops, b.c. 1556, who is said to have been succeeded by sixteen
   legendary kings and twelve archons. Draco made laws for it, b.c. 624.
   Solon, its noted ''lawgiver,"" founded a democracy, b.c. 594. The city
   was taken by Xerxes, b.c. 480; but soon after his defeat it reached its
   highest prosperity, with a population of from 120,000 to 180,000. Under
   the brilliant rule of Pericles, b.c. 444 to 429, some of the greatest
   masters in philosophy, poetry, and oratory flourished, and noted
   buildings and temples, as that of Zeus, the Odeum, the Parthenon, the
   Propylaea, were projected or completed. His rule was followed by the
   Spartan, the Theban, and the Macedonian supremacy, the age of
   Demosthenes, Philip, and Alexander the Great. In b.c. 140, Athens with
   Achaia became a Roman province, and so continued through apostolic
   times. Since then it has been subject to the Byzantines, Franks,
   Venetians, and Turks, as well as at times independent. Under the
   misrule of the Turks it sunk down to a miserable village, and in 1832
   there was scarcely a house standing. But it arose with the new kingdom
   of Greece, and is now again a beautiful capital, adorned by new streets
   and buildings, prominent among which are the royal palace, the Greek
   cathedral, the Russian chapel, the University, the Library, and the
   Museum.

   At the time of Paul's visit Athens was a ""free city,"" under the Roman
   rule. It was given to idolatry, having 30,000 idols. Petronius said,
   ""It was easier to find a god in Athens than to find a man."" Paul calls
   them ""very religious,"" Acts 17:22, not ""too superstitious,"" as our
   version inaccurately reads. But Athens never took a prominent place in
   church history.","",1

453,Atonement,"ATONE'MENT. Literally, at-onement, or reconciliation; theologically,
   the satisfaction or propitiation brought about by the death of Christ
   as the ground of the accord or reconciliation between God and man. The
   word occurs often in the Old Testament, but only once in the New (Rom
   5:11, where the Greek means ""reconciliation,"" which is the result of
   the atoning death of Christ). The subject itself is presented in every
   variety of form both in the Gospels and in the Epistles. Rom 3-8 and
   Heb 7-10, inclusive.

   The great atonement made for sin by the sacrifice of Christ constitutes
   the grand substantial foundation of the Christian faith. The efficacy
   of it is such that the sinner, though by nature the child of wrath, by
   faith in Christ is brought into favor with God, is delivered from
   condemnation, and made an heir of eternal life and glory. The Hebrew
   word rendered ""atonement"" signifies ""covering,"" Ps 32:1, and the Greek
   version of this Hebrew word is translated ""propitiation"" in our Bible,
   and may denote either that our offences are covered or that we are
   protected from the curse, Christ being made a curse for us. Gal 3:13.
   Generally, wherever the term occurs, a state of controversy or
   estrangement is implied; and in relation to the party offended, it
   imports something done to propitiate. Gen 32:20; Eze 16:63. The idea of
   making an atonement is expressed by a word which signifies ""to make
   propitiation;"" and the apostles, in referring to the death of Christ,
   use those very terms which in the Septuagint version of the Old
   Testament are applied to legal sacrifices and their effect, thus
   representing the death of Christ not only as a real and proper
   sacrifice, but as the truth and substance of all the Levitical types
   and shadows -- the true, efficacious, and only atonement for sin, 1
   John 2:2 and 1 John 4:10; showing that Christ is not only the agent by
   whom the propitiation is made, but was himself the propitiatory
   sacrifice.","",1
454,Atonement,"ATONE'MENT, DAY OF. Lev 16; Lev 23:27-32. The only Jewish fast-day; the
   annual day of humiliation. It was kept five days before the Feast of
   Tabernacles, or on the tenth day of Tisri; i.e. in the early part of
   October. The fast lasted from sunset to sunset. It was kept as a solemn
   Sabbath. Once a year upon this day did the high priest alone enter the
   holy of holies. This was the preparation. It was ordained that he
   should bathe himself, and then dress in holy white linen. He was then
   to bring forward his sacrifices, which must be his purchases -- a young
   bullock for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering. These he
   offered for himself and family. Besides these, he brought forward two
   goats for a sin-offering and a ram for a burnt-offering. These, being
   for the benefit of the people, were paid for out of the public
   treasury. The two goats were then led up to the entrance of the
   tabernacle and lots cast upon them, one lot marked ""For Jehovah."" the
   other marked ""For Azazel"" The latter is a phrase of unusual difficulty.
   But the best modern scholars agree that it does not designate the goat,
   but the personal being to whom the goat was sent. See Goat, Scape. The
   high priest offered the bullock, carried live coals in a censer from
   the altar, with a handful of incense, into the holy of holies. There he
   sprinkled the blood with his finger upon the mercy-seat, eastward, and
   before it seven times. He then killed the goat ""for Jehovah"" and
   sprinkled its blood in the same manner. Over the goat ""for Azazel"" the
   sins of the people were confessed by the high priest, and then it was
   sent away by ""the hand of a fit man into the wilderness."" The ceremony
   was now over. Accordingly, the high priest again bathed, put on his
   usual garments, and offered the two rams.","",1

   transgressions. An avenger is the agent or instrument by whom the
   avengement is visited on the offending party.

   46:1; 1 Sam 12:10; 1 Kgs 11:33. That the divinities were derived from
   astrological fancies there is little doubt, but it is a question with
   what pair of the heavenly bodies we are to identify them. The common
   opinion is that they represent the sun and moon respectively, while
   other scholars say they are Jupiter and Venus. The license sanctioned
   -- indeed, demanded -- by their worship may have given it
   attractiveness. At all events, it spread among the Jews, being
   introduced into Israel by Jezebel and by her daughter into Judaea. Many
   and severe were the judgments required to eradicate it.

   Baal side of an Altar from a temple in Kunawat (Canatha), east of the

   The frequent use of the word Baal in the plural form, Baalim, e.g. Jud
   2:11; Jud 10:10;1 Kgs 18:18; Jer 9:14; Hos 2:13, 2 Sam 21:17, proves
   probably that he was worshipped under his different modifications.
   Hence several compounds exist.
    1. Ba'al-be'rith (covenant lord), the form of Baal worshipped by the
       Shechemites after Gideon's death. Jud 8:33; Jud 9:4.
    2. Ba'al-pe'or (lord of the opening, an allusion to the character of
       the rites of worship), the form of Baal-worship in Moab and Midian
       shared in by the Israelites. Num 25:3, 1 Chr 6:5, 1 Sam 30:18; Deut
       4:3; Josh 22:17; Ps 106:28; Hos 9:10.
    3. Ba'al-ze'bub (lord of the fly), the form of Baal worshipped at
       Ekron. 2 Kgs 1:2-3, 1 Chr 24:6, Ex 17:16.

   Human victims were offered to Baal. Jer 19:5. Elevated places were
   selected for his worship, and his priests and prophets were very
   numerous. Sometimes the tops of the houses were devoted to this
   purpose. 2 Kgs 23:12; Jer 32:29. See High Places.

   The worship of Baal by the ancient Druids was probably general
   throughout the British Islands. One of the Druidic yearly festivals and
   deemed of special importance took place in the beginning of May, which
   was the first month of their year, and called Be'el-tin, or ""fire of
   God."" A large fire was kindled on some elevated spot in honor of the
   sun, whose returning beneficence they thus welcomed after the gloom of
   winter. Of this custom a trace remains in ""Beltin Day"" (or Whitsunday)
   in many of the Gaelic-speaking parts of Scotland. In the Lowlands the
   same name was retained till a comparatively recent date.

   origin and early history are unknown. It is now famous for its colossal
   ruins, consisting chiefly of two magnificent temples. The lesser of the

   rows of immense columns, 45 feet high, standing about 9 feet from the
   temple walls, the distance between the columns being from 8 to 12 feet.
   Robinson counted 19 of these columns still in place in 1852. The larger
   temple, that of the Sun, was an immense structure, 324 feet long, and
   was surrounded by a peristyle of 54 vast Corinthian columns, about 7
   feet in diameter, and, including capital and pedestal, 89 feet high.
   Over these Corinthian capitals the temple was bordered with a frieze.
   The temples were constructed of limestone or marble and granite. Some
   of the stones used in them are 64 feet long and 12 feet thick. The

   mortar. Jewish traditions and early profane writers say that the tower
   was destroyed. The captive Jews at Babylon imagined they recognized it,
   however, in the famous temple of Belus, which some would identify with
   the temple of Nebo at Borsippa, the modern Birs Nimrud. Rawlinson
   thinks that Birs Nimrud cannot be identical with either the temple of
   Belus or the tower of Babel, but concedes that it may be used to show
   the probable form of the Babel tower. The Birs Nimrud is one of the
   most striking ruins on the plain, and is 6 miles southwest of Hillah,
   on the Euphrates. This immense mound is about 2300 feet in
   circumference and 235 to 250 feet high, and was built of burnt bricks,
   each brick being 12 inches square and 4 inches thick. Several of them
   bear an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar. The tower is represented as in
   the form of a pyramid, built in seven receding stories, each placed
   upon the south-western side of the one below, and each of the first
   three being 26 feet high, each of the last four being 15 feet high. On
   the seventh story was a temple or ark, perhaps with a statue of the god
   Belus. George Smith, the Assyriologist (and the Encyclopedia
   Britannica, vol. iii. p. 155, ninth edition, adopts Smith's view),
   says, ""The Birs Nimrud is most probably the tower of Babel of the book
   of Genesis."" Mr. Smith describes another ruin called Babil or Mujelliha
   as the one which in his view covers the site of the temple of Belus,
   and the great tower of Babylon (not Babel). Birs Nimrud seems to have
   been a temple dedicated to the heavenly bodies, and the inscriptions on
   cylinders found there record that Nebuchadnezzar rebuilt the edifice
   after it had been left unfinished by others. Further excavations may
   solve these unsettled questions. See Rawlinson's Herodotus, and George
   Smith's Assyrian Discoveries, 1875. BAB'YLON (Greek form of Babel), the

   modern city of Bagdad. The valley is broad, and the Euphrates is now
   about 600 feet wide and 18 feet deep at this place.

   Extent of the City. It was the largest known ancient city in extent.
   According to Herodotus, the city was a vast square on both sides of the
   Euphrates, enclosed by a double line of walls, about 56 miles in
   circuit and including about 200 square miles. Ctesias and others make
   the circuit about 42 miles, enclosing about 106 square miles. The
   walls, according to Herodotus, were about 335 feet high and 75 feet
   broad. Ctesias, quoted by Diodorus, states that they were 200 feet high
   and built by 2,000,000 men. Later writers, regarding these measurements
   as incredible, give the circuit of the walls at about 40 miles, their
   height at 75 to 190 feet, and their width at 32 feet, or wide enough to
   allow two chariots to pass each other on the top. M. Oppert and
   Rawlinson as explorers hold that the ruins warrant the statement of
   Herodotus as to the extent of Babylon. Its size --if 200 square miles
   --largely exceeded that of any modern city. The area of London is 122
   square miles; Paris, 30; Pekin, 50; New York (1873), 42; and
   Philadelphia, 129 square miles. The wall of Babylon was surmounted by
   250 towers, and it had 100 gates of brass. Jer 51:68; [1]miumiu ?? ??

   Streets and Buildings--Babylon is described as cut into squares some
   say 676 --by straight streets crossing each other at right angles,
   those at the river being closed by brazen gates, as the banks of the
   river were fortified by high walls; the river was crossed by
   drawbridges and lined with quays; the two palaces on opposite sides of
   the river were connected by a bridge, and also by a tunnel under the
   river. Among the wonderful buildings were, (1.) Nebuchadnezzar's
   Palace, an immense pile of buildings, believed to be nearly 6 miles in
   circumference. (2.) The Hanging-Gardens one of the Seven Wonders of the
   world, built by Nebuchadnezzar to please his queen, Amytis, who longed
   for her native mountains. These gardens were 75 feet high and covered 3
   1/2 acres, enclosed in an area of larger extent, some say 1000 feet on
   each side. Upon this mountain was soil of depth to support the largest
   trees, and water was drawn up from the river by means of a screw. (3).
   The Temple of Belus, a vast pyramid or tower, 600 feet square, having
   eight stages, or stories, and according to Rawlinson 480 feet high,
   with a winding ascent passing around it, and a chapel of a god at the
   top.

   Scripture History. Babylon is named over 250 times in the Bible. It was
   founded by Nimrod, Gen 10:10; its builders dispersed, Gen 11:9. Then,
   except some allusion to Shinar, Gen 14:1, the Chaldaeans, Job 1:17, and
   the Babylonish garment, Josh 7:21, it drops out of Scripture history
   until the era of the Captivity. It was often subject to Assyria, 2 Chr
   33:11, and was the residence of at least one Assyrian king. After the
   fall of Nineveh, b.c. 625, it became an independent kingdom, and under
   Nebuchadnezzar was enlarged, beautified, and reached the height of its
   magnificence. See Isa 13:19; [2]miumiu ??Isa 47:5; Jer 51:41, where it
   is called "" the glory of kingdoms,"" "" the golden city,"" "" the praise of
   the whole earth,"" etc. It was the home of the chief of the captive
   Jews, Dan 1:1-4, and was taken by the army of Cyrus under Darius, Dan
   5. Its desolation was frequently foretold. Isa 13:4-22; Jer 25:12; Jer
   50:2-3; Jer 25:51; Dan 2:31-38; Hab 1:5-10. It was taken by Alexander
   the Great, who died there. It gradually became a complete ruin,
   fulfilling the prophecy, Babylon "" shall never be inhabited, . . . wild
   beasts of the deserts shall lie there."" Ruins--Though for centuries
   Babylon has been the source of building-material for the towns of all
   the adjacent region, yet the ruins are very extensive, covering,
   according to Oppert, 200 square miles. Among them are, (1.) The Babil
   or Mujelliha, 600 feet square and 140 feet high, probably the site of
   the ancient temple of Belus. The mound is mainly built of sun-dried
   brick and filled with burnt brick, the latter bearing the name of
   Nebuchadnezzar. (2.) The Kasr, or Nebuchadnezzar's palace, south of
   Babil, about 2100 feet long by 1800 feet broad, and 70 feet high. It is
   composed of bricks, tiles, and fragments of stone. Some of the bricks
   are glazed; others resemble fire [3]www.miumiu-yahoos.com

   brick, and bear the name of Nebuchadnezzar. (3.) The Amram, a large
   mound, possibly the ruins of the

   Sculptured Lion over a Prostrate Man. (Discovered in the ruins of
   Babylon by Rich.)

   famous hanging - gardens, though more probably a palace of the earlier
   kings. See Rawlinson's Five Ancient Monarchies, 1870, ii. 532. (4.)
   Birs Nimrud, 6 miles south-west of Hillah, at ancient Borsippa, and by
   many regarded as covering the tower of Babel. See Babel. Many
   corroborations of Scripture have

   Birs Nimrud. (After Plumptre's Biblical Educator )

   been furnished by the Assyrian tablets deciphered by Oriental scholars.
   Near the hanging-gardens a sculptured lion standing over a man with
   outstretched arms may illustrate the mode of punishment to which Daniel
   was condemned. Dan 6:16. George Smith, after a careful exploration,
   quite decidedly dissents from historians and other explorers in
   ascribing so great an extent to Babylon. In his opinion, there is no
   ground in the inscriptions or ruins for making Babylon over about 8
   miles in circuit, or nearly the same size as its sister-city, Nineveh.
   He regards its shape as a square with one corner cut off. At the north
   was the temple of Belus, now the mound Babil; about the centre of the
   city were the palace and hanging-gardens, both now represented, in his
   view, by the mound Kasr, as he places the gardens between the palace
   and the river. George Smith concludes that the few pits and tunnels
   made in the ruins are acknowledged to be insufficient to decide any of
   the questions as to sites, which can only be done by satisfactory
   excavations, and hence that the ""recovery of Babylon is yet to be
   accomplished."" Assyrian Discoveries, 1875, pp. 55-59. -- The modern
   town of Hillah now occupies a portion of the space covered by the ruins
   of ancient Babylon, and a telegraph connects it with the city of
   Bagdad. See Chaldea, Assyria.","",1
514,Babylon,"BAB'YLON, in Rev 14:8;Rev 16:19;Rev 17:5; Ps 18:2, 2 Chr 11:21, is a
   symbolical name for heathen Rome, which took the place of ancient
   Babylon as a persecuting power. This is also the sense given to Babylon
   in 1 Pet 5:13 by the fathers and many commentators; but others refer it
   to Babylon in Asia, since it is quite possible that Peter labored for a
   while in that city, where there was at that time a large Jewish colony;
   still others maintain that Babylon in Egypt, now called Old Cairo is
   meant.

   BABYLON, PROVINCE OR KINGDOM OF, the country of which Babylon was the
   capital.

   Dan 2:19; Dan 3:1, Jud 4:12, 1 Kgs 20:30; Dan 4:29, Its boundaries and
   history are involved in much obscurity. It was originally known as the
   "" land of Shinar "" and the ""land of Nimrod,"" Gen 10:1; Mic 5:6. It was
   chiefly between the Euphra-

   tes and Tigris Rivers. Asshur or Assyria and Mesopotamia were on the
   north, Elam and Media on the east, Chaldea on the south. As Chaldea
   gained in power its name was applied to the whole country, including
   Babylon. See Chaldea. The early kingdom of Babylon is generally
   regarded as covering an extent of about 27,000 square miles, rich of
   soil and abundant in resources, the home of one of the earliest
   civilized nations. After the time of Nimrod, Babel or Babylon appears
   to be displaced in Scripture history by Chaldea until the time of
   Joshua, Josh 7:21; after this both again disappear until about the time
   of the Captivity. At the fall of Nineveh, b.c. 626, Babylonia speedily
   extended its sway over most of western Asia and Egypt, and under
   Nebuchadnezzar became a vast empire, lasting, however, less than a
   century, and fell before the Medians under Cyrus and Darius, b.c. 538,
   and soon after dropped out of history as a separate country.

   General History. -- Bernsus gives a list of ten mythical kings,
   including Xisithrus, who ruled Babylonia before the Flood; while the
   inscriptions so far discovered on the tablets and monuments give three
   mythical kings before the Flood, and four after it. From the
   inscriptions, long lists of kings during the historical period have
   also been deciphered. The earliest list of twelve kings in this period
   begins with Izdubar, who is identified with Nimrod by George Smith. To
   this list he adds from the inscriptions the names of six viceroys, six
   kings of Ur, five kings of Karrak, six of Erech and Larsa, five of
   Akkad, and four Elamite kings; and among the latter is Chedorlaomer of
   Gen 14:1-17. Five native kings were contemporary with these Elamite
   kings, and twenty other kings ruled successively until the accession of
   an Assyrian dynasty in b.c. 1271. The last list given by George Smith
   from the inscriptions covers the period from b.c. 1150 to 539, and
   includes Sargon, b.c. 710, Merodach-baladan III., restored b.c. 705,
   Esarhaddon, who rebuilt Babylon, b.c. 681, Assurbanipal, b.c. 648,
   Nebuchadnezzar III., the Nebuchadnezzar of Scripture, b.c. 605,
   Amil-maruduk, the Evil-merodach of the Bible, b.c. 562, and
   Bel-sar-uzar, the Belshazzar of the book of Daniel, and who reigned
   with his father until the fall of the Babylonian empire, b.c. 538. It
   is not certain how far back the records of Babylonia reach, but George
   Smith regards it as certain that they reach to the twenty fourth
   century before Christ, and some scholars would stretch them nearly two
   thousand years beyond that early period. The civilization, literature,
   and government found in Babylonia two thousand years before the
   Christian era could not have sprung up in a day, but further
   explorations only can determine its age. Among the biblical cities
   named in the earliest inscriptions -- those of Izdubar -- are Babylon,
   Cuthah, and Erech, thus adding new light to the truth of Scripture
   history. See George Smith's Assyrian Discoveries, 1875, chap. 23. The
   Babylonian Empire. -- Upon the fall of Nineveh, b.c. 625, the
   Chaldaeans and Babylonians controlled all the southern and western
   portions of the former Assyrian empire. This Babylonian empire
   extended, therefore, over Susiana, Elam, Mesopotamia, Syria including
   Palestine and Phoenicia, Idumaea, northern Arabia, and lower Egypt.
   Among the important cities of the empire were Babylon, Borsippa,
   Sippara or Sepharvaim. Isa 36:19, Cuthah, 2 Kgs 17:24, Orchoe or Erech,
   in Babylonia; and in the provinces, Susa, Carchemish, Harran, Hamath,
   Damascus, Jerusalem, Tyre, Sidon, Ashdod, Askelon, and Gaza. Of those
   in the provinces, Susa was of the first importance, and may be regarded
   as the second city of the empire. It had a royal palace, where the
   Babylonian kings spent a portion of their time, Dan 8:2, doubtless
   during the heat of summer. The dominant people in the Babylonian empire
   were, according to Rawlinson and others, a mixed race, mainly
   descendants of the earlier Chaldaeans (who were chiefly Cushites),
   mixed with those of the later Assyrians, who were of the Semitic type.
   The Babylonians were celebrated for their wisdom and learning, Dan 1:4;
   Jer 50:35; Isa 47:10, especially for their knowledge of astronomy. They
   were also a commercial, avaricious, and luxurious people, Hab 2:9; Jer
   51:13; Isa 47:8, though they were likewise valorous and war

   like. Their princes were proud and boastful. ""Is not this great
   Babylon, that I have built ... by the might of my power, and for the
   honor of my majesty?'' was the boastful speech of its greatest king,
   Nebuchadnezzar. Dan 4:30.

   In architecture, sculpture, science, philosophy, astronomical and
   mathematical knowledge, and in learning the Babylonians made original
   investigations and discoveries not surpassed by any other ancient
   people. "" To Babylonia,"" says G. Rawlinson, ""far more than to Egypt, we
   owe the art and learning of the Greeks."" --Five Ancient Monarchies,
   iii. 76.

   In religion the Babylonians differed little from the early Chaldaeans.
   Their chief deities were Bel, Merodach, and Nebo. The names of these
   gods frequently appear in the names of noted princes, as Bel-shazzar,
   Nabo-polassar, Merodach-baladan, Evil-merodach Abed-nebo or -nego.
   Their gods were worshipped with great pomp and magnificence. The
   temples erected in honor of the gods and devoted to their worship were
   celebrated for their vastness, and for the massiveness and finish of
   their sculptures. Of the precise mode of their worship little is known.
   It was conducted by priests, through whom the worshippers made
   offerings, often of great value, and sacrifices of oxen and goats.
   Images of the gods were exhibited, probably on frames or sacred
   vehicles, and, as some suppose, were some times set up in a public
   place, as on the plain of Dura, Dan 3:1; but late investigations
   indicate that the image there set up was a statue of Nebuchadnezzar.
   See on this text Canon Cook's Bible Commentary, 1876. Some of the
   principal temples of their gods noted by Rawlinson were that of Bel at
   Babylon, another of the same god at Niffer, one of Beltis at Warka or
   Erech, one of the Sun-god at Sippara or Sepharvaim, and one of Nebo at
   Borsippa.

   The empire began with the accession of Nabo-polassar, b.c. 625: was in
   its greatest prosperity during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, lasting
   forty -four years, to b.c. 561. See Nebuchadnezzar. Under the less able
   rulers who followed, the power of the empire declined, and it fell a
   comparatively easy prey to the Medo-Persians under Cyrus, b.c. 538. See

528,Balaam,"BA'LAAM (glutton) was the son of Beor or Bosor, and a native of Pethor,
   a village of Mesopotamia. Num 22:5. He had a great reputation as a
   prophet or soothsayer, and appears to have been a worshipper of the one
   God, coming from the country of Abraham, where it is in every way
   probable that remnants of the primitive monotheism existed to his day.
   His history is given in Num 22, Num 23, Num 24, and Num 31. So great
   was his fame that Balak, king of Moab, sent for him to curse Israel
   when they were encamped upon the plains of Moab; but he consulted God
   during the night, and the next morning refused, declaring the Lord had
   not given him leave. But Balak sent again, and Balaam at length
   obtained the desired permission to go, and went. It was on this journey
   that his ass spake. Num 22:28. Arriving, he ordered Balak to build
   seven altars, and to offer a bullock and a ram on each. Then,
   proclaiming his intention of speaking only what God showed unto him, he
   twice went aside to watch for an augury. God met him each time and told
   him what to say, and on his return he uttered a blessing instead of the
   expected curse. The third time the sacrifices were offered, but Balaam
   saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel; so, without seeking an
   augury, he uttered these magnificent prophecies, in which Israel's
   complete supremacy is announced:


   ""How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob,

   Thy tabernacles, O Israel!

   As valleys are they spread forth.

   As gardens by the river side.

   As lign aloes which the Lord hath planted,

   As cedar trees beside the waters.

   He shall flow with water from his buckets,

   And his seed shall be in many waters,

   And his king shall be higher than Agag,

   And his kingdom shall be exalted.

   God, he bringeth him forth out of Egypt;

   He hath as it were the strength of a buffalo;

   He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,

   And shall break their bones in pieces,


   And smite them through with his arrows.

   He couched, he lay down as a lion,

   And as a lioness, who shall stir him up?

   Blessed is he that blesseth thee.

   And cursed is he that curseth thee.""

   Num 24:5-9.

   And again


   ""There shall come forth a Star out of Jacob,

   And a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel,

   And shall smite through the corners of Moab,

   And break down all the sons of tumult.""

   Num 24:17.

   The prophecies of Balaam are justly regarded as some of the most
   remarkable in Scripture. But having won the anger of Balak by his
   course, and feeling himself cast out from the people of God by reason
   of his sinfulness, he became desperate, and endeavored to do as much
   immediate harm to Israel as he could, since he could in no wise injure
   her future. He therefore suggested that the Moabites destroy the purity
   of Israel by seducing the people into fornication while taking part in
   the worship of Baal. Num 31:16; cf. Num 25:1-5. They did so; and the
   consequence was, a plague broke out among the Israelites and killed
   24,000 of them. Num 25:9. In a battle fought by Israel with the
   Midianites, Balaam was slain. Num 31:8. The phrase ""the doctrine of

   would carry two sorts of weights, the lighter to sell with, and the
   other to buy with. This explains the allusions Mic 6:11; Hos 12:7.

   In pictures on monuments is represented a balance in which the scales
   are simply a pair of weights. There are two bags of money which are to

   the four grand divisions of the host of Israel, Num 1:52, distinguished
   from the others by colors and by an emblematic device. Thus, according
   to the rabbins, the device of Judah was a lion; that of Reuben was a
   man; that of Ephraim, an ox; of Dan, an eagle. Another standard for
   subdivisions, denoted by another word, was probably nothing more than a
   common spear richly burnished or ornamented. The Egyptian princes used
   a standard like this, surmounted with a ball of gold. There was another
   standard in use among the Jews, which is called a beacon. Isa 30:17. It
   was stationary, erected on lofty mountains, and used as a rallying
   token. Comp. Isa 18:3; Isa 62:10; Jer 4:6, 2 Chr 11:21; Gen 6:1; Jer
   51:12, Jer 51:27. None of these standards were flags.

   Some writers have supposed that the ancient Jewish ensign was a long
   pole, on the top of which was a grate not unlike a chaffing-dish, made
   of iron bars and supplied with fire, the size, height, and shape of
   which denoted the party or company to whom it belonged. This seems

543,Banquet,BAN'QUET. See Feast.,"",1
544,Baptism,"BAP'TISM, an ordinance or religious rite which was in use before
   Christ's ministry began, but which he recognized, and which was
   continued by his disciples as a Christian ordinance. Matt 28:19, Ruth
   4:20; Mark 16:16. On the due administration of this rite, the use of
   water in the name of the Holy Trinity becomes the sign or emblem of
   inward purification from sin and uncleanness, while the subject of the
   rite is introduced into a peculiar relation to Christ and his Church.
   Baptism is in the N. T. what circumcision was in the Old--a sign and
   seal of the covenant of grace whereby God promises forgiveness of sin
   and salvation, and man vows obedience and devotion to his service. See
   Acts 2:41; Rom 6:3-4; Gal 3:27; 1 Pet 3:21. It was first administered
   on the day of Pentecost. Christ himself did not baptize, John 4:2, and
   the apostles received instead the baptism of fire and the Holy Ghost,
   Acts 2. In the case of Cornelius regeneration preceded water-baptism,
   Acts 10:44-48; while, on the other hand, in the case of Simon Magus,
   water-baptism was not accompanied or followed by regeneration. Acts
   8:13, Acts 8:21-23. Nevertheless, God is true though men should abuse
   his gifts and turn his blessing into a curse. The controversy between
   Baptists and Paedobaptists refers to the subjects and to the mode of
   baptism. The former hold that adult believers only are to be baptized,
   and that immersion is the only valid mode of baptism; the latter
   maintain that children of believing parents may and ought to be
   baptized, and that baptism may be administered by sprinkling and
   pouring as well as by immersion.

   Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire. Matt 3:11; Luke 3:16. The
   phrase is figurative, and refers to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit
   upon believers, as on the day of Pentecost especially, but often since
   in the history of the Church.

   Baptism of John the Baptist.--John was a preacher of righteousness; his
   baptism was significant of the inward cleansing which followed
   repentance, and was introductory to the higher baptism instituted by
   Christ. John said to his disciples, ""I indeed baptize you with water
   unto repentance: but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose
   shoes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy
   Ghost, and with fire."" Matt 3:11. He demanded faith in the Messiah,
   sorrow for sin, and trust in God, as prerequisites for the
   administration of the rite, which, however, differed from Christian
   baptism in that it implied no belief in the Trinity, nor was it
   followed by the gift of the Holy Ghost. Those who had received John's
   baptism were rebaptized. See Acts 19:1-6; cf. Matt 3; Acts 18:25-26.

   Baptism for the Dead.--There is only one allusion to this practice in
   the N. T., in 1 Cor 15:29: ""What shall they do which are baptized for
   the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for
   the dead?"" Paul evidently speaks of a well-known ceremony. Various
   interpretations have been put upon the phrase. It is simplest to say
   with Meyer, Paul refers to the belief that a living Christian could be
   baptized for a dead Christian who was unbaptized, and the latter would
   in consequence be accounted baptized and have part in the eternal joys.
   This custom, abandoned by the Church--a proof that it was condemned by
   the leaders--was kept up among heretics, such as the Cerinthians and
   Marcionites, and is practised at the present day by the Mormons in
   Utah. Chrysostom tells us that when an unbaptized catechumen died, a
   living man was put under the bed on which the dead body lay. The priest
   then asked the dead man if he desired baptism. The living man answered
   in the affirmative, and was baptized in place of the dead. The
   practice, of course, was superstitious, and Paul merely uses it in
   argument, but does not approve of it. Indeed, his use of the third
   person shows that the notion of the paramount importance of baptism
   which led to the custom was condemned by him.

   Other interpretations of the phrase have been given. Thus, ""If the dead
   rise not, then baptism could have no authority and no use, because then
   Christ did not rise."" Again, ""Baptized when death is close at hand.""
   ""Over the graves of the martyrs."" ""If there be no resurrection, why art
   thou then baptized for the dead-- i. e. for the dead bodies? For in
   this faith thou art baptized, believing in the resurrection of the
   dead.""","",1

   the time of the Jewish Passover. The Jews were permitted to name any
   one whose release they desired; and when the choice lay between
   Barabbas and Christ, they chose the robber. Matt 27:21; Mark 15:6-11;
   Luke 23:18; John 18:40; Acts 3:14. Pilate was anxious to save Christ,
   but at last released Barabbas.

   two ranges of mountains, one along the Jordan valley, about 3000 feet
   high, another irregular range on the east side of Bashan; between them
   are plains or undulating table-land watered by springs. The rock of
   basalt on the west is broken into deep chasms and jagged projections;
   the hills are covered with oak-forests, as in former times. Isa 2:13;
   Eze 27:6; Zech 11:2. The plain of the Jaulan (Golan of Scripture) is a
   vast field of powdered lava and basalt, a fertile pasture to this day.
   The north-eastern portion of Bashan, including the Argob of Scripture,
   is a wild mass of basaltic rock, 22 miles long by 14 wide, resembling a
   ""cyclopean wall in ruins."" Fissures and chasms cut it like a network
   and it abounds in caves, yet has much fertile land. The centre of

   king, was defeated and slain by Israel, Num 21:33; Num 32:33, and the
   country divided; its pastures, cattle, sheep, oaks, and forests were
   famous. Deut 32:14; Ps 22:12; Isa 2:13; Jer 50:19; Eze 39:18. After the
   Captivity it was divided into four provinces: (1) Gaulanitis, or modern
   Jaulan; (2) Argob, or Trachonitis, now Lejah; (3) Auranitis, now
   Haurau; (4) Batanaea. Ituraea was not strictly a part of Bashan, though
   taken by Israel. Under the Roman rule the division was but slightly
   changed. The country is now nominally under Turkish rule, but is really
   held by tribes of Arabs, dangerous, warlike, and unsubdued.

   Ruins.---Bashan is almost literally crowded with cities and villages,
   now deserted and in ruins, corroborating the account in Scripture. Josh
   13:30. There are four classes of dwellings:(1) the natural cavern
   fitted up for residence. (2) Long tunnels descending obliquely,
   sometimes 150 feet, at the bottom of which run out a number of passages
   or underground streets, 16 to 23 feet wide, lined on either side by
   subterranean dwellings furnished with air-holes in the ceilings, each
   generally having only one outlet, and that in a rocky, precipitous
   slope. (3) Dwellings cut in the rock and covered over with stone
   vaulting; not all of these, however, belong to early biblical times.
   Deut 3:4-13. (4) The villages in the Hauran consist chiefly of
   dwellings built of handsome well-hewn stone, closely jointed without
   cement. Wood was nowhere used. The gates, doors, and window-shutters
   are of stone, turning on stone hinges; the roofs are also of stone,
   resting on supports and arches of the same material. Some of the
   gateways are ornamented with sculptured vines and bear numerous
   inscriptions yet undeciphered, while within are stone cupboards,
   benches, and candlesticks. Many of these dwellings belong to an age
   since the beginning of the Christian era, but, though deserted for
   centuries, seem almost as if the occupants had gone out only for a few
   hours. Porter's views on their antiquity are not accepted. Among its
   cities mentioned in Scripture are Golan, Ashteroth, Karnaim, Edrei,
   Salcah, Kerioth, and Bozrah. See these titles, and Porter's Giant
   Cities (1865-6), Merrill's East of Jordan (1881), and Baedeker's
   Handbook of Syria and Palestine (1876).","",1

   and cups so often mentioned together exactly differed, but the basins
   were probably small. ""The 'basin' from which Jesus washed his
   disciples' feet was probably larger and deeper than the hand-basin for
   sprinkling."" John 13:5.","",1
567,Basket,"BAS'KET. The word is the uniform term by which several picturesque
   Hebrew terms are translated. The context will generally enable us to
   decide not only on the probable size of the ""basket,"" but also on its
   material. Thus, that mentioned in Jud 6:19 must have been of metal,
   while that in which Paul was let down from the wall at Damascus was of
   rope. 2 Cor 11:33. Wicker was, however, probably the usual material.
   They were of all shapes, sizes, and for all purposes. The fact is
   unfortunately concealed in our version

   Egyptian Baskets. (After Wilkinson.)

   that the word for ""basket"" in the account of the miracle of feeding the
   five thousand, Matt 14:20; Matt 16:9; Mark 6:43; Luke 9:17; John 6:13,
   is entirely different from that similarly translated in the miracle of
   feeding the four thousand. Matt 15:37; Mark 8:8 -- an indirect but
   striking proof that there were two miracles. It is not, however,
   possible to tell wherein the difference consisted.","",1

   congregation -- i. e. ""from intermarrying with pure Hebrews."" But since
   concubinage was tolerated, the term evidently does not apply to one
   born out of wedlock. ""The Rabbins, therefore, are probably right when
   they interpret the word as denoting only those born of incest or
   adultery."" See Concubine.","",1

   uses for this purpose are altogether different from those of a bird.","",1
571,Bath,"BATH. See Measures.

   BATH, BATH'ING. In Eastern lands bathing is a necessity as well as a
   luxury. It is characteristic of the Mosaic cultus that it enjoins such
   frequent washings; e.g. Lev 14:8; Lev 15:5; Lev 17:15. The high priest
   on the day of atonement must pay particular attention to this
   regulation. Lev 16:4, Lev 16:24. The Jews bathed in running water or in
   pools in courts. It was not until their subjection to Greece and Rome
   that public baths were known. Then came in also the luxurious
   bathing-customs of those peoples.","",1

   otherwise called Ammiel, 1 Chr 3:5, Ahithophel's son, 2 Sam 23:34. She
   became the wife of Uriah, an officer in David's army. Her beauty proved
   a snare to David, for he not only committed adultery with her, but
   treacherously procured the death of her injured husband. 2 Sam 11:1-27.
   The child of this intercourse died. When the days of mourning were
   accomplished, David married her, and she afterward bore him three sons
   besides Solomon. When Adonijah attempted to seize the throne,
   Bath-sheba told the king at the instigation of Nathan. 1 Kgs 1:15. It
   was to her as queen-mother that Adonijah went with the request for the

   wood, usually oak, sometimes connected with a carriage or framework of
   heavy timber. One end was shaped like a ram's head, which when driven
   repeatedly and with great force against the wall of a city or
   fortification either pierced it or battered it down. In the tower of

   flat roofs of Eastern houses, designed as a partition from an adjoining
   building or to prevent persons from falling off. The law required a
   battlement to be built upon every house. It is sometimes used in a more
   extensive sense to denote the fortifications of a city. Jer 5:10. A
   traveller says that at Aleppo, where the houses join each other, the
   battlements are so low that he could walk over the tops of a dozen

   of Palestine. It is not very common, but may be found in most of the
   wooded dells of northern and western Palestine."" -- Tristram. The

582,Bdellium,"BDELL'IUM. Gen 2:12. After much discussion, it is still impossible to
   say whether bdellium is a mineral, an animal production (pearl), or a
   vegetable exudation. It is probably the latter. There is a gum produced
   in the East Indies which has the same name and is thought by many to be
   the same substance. It resembles myrrh in color, and is of a bitter
   taste. Num 11:7.","",1

   extreme south of Judah, Josh 15:24; probably the same as Baalath-beer,
   Josh 19:8, the modern Kurnub.","",1
586,Beans,"BEANS. Eze 4:9. The Eastern plant ordinarily thus known (Vieia faba) is
   quite unlike the garden or field bean of the United States. It is of
   the same family, but is an erect annual with a stout stem, is one of
   the commonest field-crops of Europe and the Orient, and bears in its
   pods large coarse seeds which are fed to animals and much eaten by the
   poorer classes. Kidney-beans are now sometimes cultivated in Palestine.","",1
587,Bear,"BEAR. Prov 17:12. The Syrian bear seems but a variety of the brown bear
   of Europe and Asia, though it is much lighter in color. Its food is
   seeds, fruits, and roots, to which it occasionally adds a goat or
   sheep. ""I never but once saw the Syrian bear south of Hermon; this was
   in winter, in a rugged ravine near the Lake of Gennesaret.

   Syrian Bear. (After Tristram.)

   When we visited Hermon, before the snow had melted from the top, we
   found the snow-ridges trodden in all directions by the tracks of bears,
   which were well known, but not much feared, by the shepherds; and we
   also saw their trace in the snow on Lebanon. They descend both sides of
   Hermon and do considerable damage to the crops, especially the
   lentiles, of which they are very fond."" --Tristram. The attachment of
   the female bear to her young is very great, and nothing enrages her so
   much as to see her cubs hurt or taken from her. Hence the allusions 2
   Sam 17:8; Hos 13:8, and also the passage above cited.","",1
588,Beard,"BEARD. Among the Jews much attention was paid to the beard. To show any
   contempt toward it by

   Fig. 1. Egyptian Beards. (After Wilkinson.) Fig. 2. Beards of Assyrian,
   and other Nations. (After Rosellini and Layard.)

   plucking it or touching it, except from respect or courtesy, was
   esteemed a gross insult, while to kiss it respectfully and
   affectionately was regarded as a signal mark of friendship. Tearing out
   the beard, cutting it entirely off, and neglecting to trim and dress it
   were all expressions of deep mourning. Ezr 9:3; Isa 15:2; Jer 41:5 and
   Jer 48:37.

   The Arabs and Orientals generally at this day cherish great respect for
   the beard. They solemnly swear by it; and their most significant and
   comprehensive phrase to express their good wishes for a friend is, ""May
   God preserve your blessed beard!"" We are told of an Arab who was
   wounded in the jaw, and chose to hazard his life rather than to have
   his beard cut off that the surgeon might examine the wound. Hence the
   keenness of the insult offered to David's ambassadors. 2 Sam 10:4-5.
   The Egyptians were accustomed to shave except when mourning, the direct
   opposite to the Jewish custom, but they wore false beards, made of
   plaited hair and graduated according to rank. The prohibition, Lev
   19:27, against marring the ""corners of the beard"" refers probably to
   the Arabian custom of shaving off that portion of the beard upon the
   cheeks on a line with the ears.","",1
589,Beast,"BEAST. Gen 2:19. This word is generally used to distinguish all animals
   from man, as in Ps 36:6. Sometimes quadrupeds only are denoted by it,
   as Lev 11:2; and in Gen 1:24-25, it is supposed to refer to creatures
   that roam at large. Beasts were created on the sixth day, and were
   named by Adam. Paul describes some of his opposers as wild beasts, so
   furious and brutal was their treatment of him. 1 Cor 15:32. A similar
   application will be found in Ps 22:12-16; Eccl 3:18; Isa 11:6-8, and in
   2 Pet 2:12 and Jude 10, to denote a class of wicked men. ""Wild beasts
   of the islands"" Jer 50:39, etc., seem to be jackals (literally, ""the
   howlers,"" as in Arabic these animals are called ""the sons of howling"").
   ""Wild beasts of the desert"" probably denote such creatures as the
   hyena.

   Under the ancient dispensation the beasts were sometimes made to
   participate externally in the observance of religious ceremonies, Jon
   3:7-8, and suffered, with men, the judgment of God. Ex 9:6 and Ex
   13:15; Ps 135:8; Jer 7:20 and Jer 21:6; Eze 32:13; Eze 38:20; Hos 4:3.

595,Bed,"BED. Gen 47:31. The floors of the better sort of Eastern houses were of
   tile or plaster, and were covered with mats or carpets; and as shoes
   were not worn on them and the feet were washed, their floors seldom
   required sweeping or scrubbing. Matt 12:44; Luke 15:8. Thick, coarse
   mattresses were thrown down at night to sleep upon. The poorer people
   used skins for the same purpose. Such beds were easily moved. Matt 9:6.
   On two or three sides of the room was a bench, generally a foot high
   and three feet broad, covered with a stuffed cushion. This bench,
   called the

   Asiatic Beds. (From Fellow's ""Asia Minor."")

   divan, was used for both lying and sitting upon; but at one end of the
   room it was more elevated, and this was the usual place of sleeping. 2
   Kgs 1:4; 2 Kgs 20:2; Ps 132:3; Am 3:12. But besides the divan, we find
   mention of bedsteads made of wood, ivory, Am 6:4, or other materials.
   Deut 3:11. This knowledge of the construction of Eastern beds relieves
   of difficulty such passages as Ex 8:3; 2 Sam 4:5-7; Ps 6:6; Mark 4:21.

   Some part of the day-clothing usually served for bedclothes. Ex
   22:26-27; Deut 24:12-13. The Orientals do not generally undress before
   lying down for the night, but are content to take off the upper part of
   their clothing and unloose their girdle.

   Bedsteads were used by the ancient Egyptians, as we know from the
   monuments. They also used wooden pillows of the same style as are now
   in use in Japan.

   The pillow of the Hebrews was probably a goat-skin stuffed with some
   soft substance, since one of this sort is common to-day in Palestine.
   The pillow meant in Mark 4:38 was a rower's cushion. It has been
   conjectured that Saul and Elijah may have used their skin
   water-bottles, ""a cruse of water,"" for the purpose of a bolster. 1 Sam

   between Jerubbael, or Gideon, and Jephthah, but probably it is a
   copyist's error for Barak, as several of the versions give it. The
   difference in Hebrew is not great.

598,Bedeiah,"BEDEI'AH (servant of Jehovah), one who had married a foreign wife. Ezr

599,Bee,"BEE. Deut 1:44. The honeybee is probably the only species alluded to in
   the Bible. They must have been very numerous in Canaan, as honey was a
   common article of food, 1 Kgs 14:3; Ps 81:16; Song of Solomon 5:1; Isa
   7:15, and commerce. Eze 27:17.

   The disposition of bees to take vengeance on any one who disturbs their
   hive is alluded to in Ps 118:12.

   Isa 7:18 doubtless finds its explanation ""in the custom of the people
   in the East of attracting the attention of any one by a significant
   hiss, or rather hist."" Zech 10:8.

   We read, Jud 14:8, that ""after a time,"" probably many days, Samson
   returned to the carcass of the lion he had slain, and saw bees and
   honey therein. ""If any one here represents to himself a corrupt and
   putrid carcass, the occurrence ceases to have any true similitude, for
   it is well known that in these countries, at certain seasons of the
   year, the heat will in the course of twenty-four hours so completely
   dry up the moisture of dead camels, and that, without their undergoing
   decomposition, their bodies long remain like mummies, unaltered and
   entirely free from offensive odor.""--Oedmann.

   Sam 30:18, Acts 1:19. But this is, some say, merely because to the
   Greek tongue the latter form was easier. This name was in common use
   among the Jews in Christ's day as a title of Satan as the ""prince of
   the demons."" It means ""lord of the house."" Those who regard Beelzebul

   16 feet of the lower portion being dug into solid rock, and the portion
   above this rock walled up with square hewn stones, hard as marble. The
   ropes of water-drawers for 4000 years have worn over 140 furrows in the
   face of the stones, some of them 4 inches deep. The second well is
   smaller, being only about 5 feet in diameter and 42 feet deep. Around

   inalienable, except for a certain term, when it reverted to him or his
   posterity. And if this resource were insufficient, he could pledge the
   services of himself and family for a valuable sum. Those who were
   indigent through bodily infirmities were usually taken care of by their
   kindred. A beggar was sometimes seen, however, and was regarded and
   abhorred as a vagabond. Ps 109:10. In later times they were accustomed,
   it would seem, to have a fixed place at the corners of the streets,
   Mark 10:46, or at the gates of the temple, Acts 3:2, or of private
   houses. Luke 16:20.

   Hippopotamus. (After Wood. ""Animal Kingdom."")","",1
615,Behemoth,"BE'HEMOTH. Job 40:15-24. The word elsewhere translated beasts -- i. e.
   great beasts -- is here given in its Hebrew form. Evidently this is
   right, for Job plainly refers to a beast preeminently great. The animal
   described as the behemoth in the passage above cited was of prodigious
   size and strength, and corresponds better with the river-horse of
   Africa (Hippopotamus amphibius), than with any other known animal. It
   is very probable that this creature, though not now found in Palestine,
   may once have inhabited the rivers of Western Asia.

   The average length of the male hippopotamus (including a tail about 1
   foot long) is 14 feet. His girth is nearly the same, and his height at
   the shoulder is 5 or 6 feet. The huge, uncouth body of the animal is
   supported by short, stout limbs with four toes, each of which toes has
   a small hoof. The aperture of his mouth is 2 feet broad, and his tusks
   are more than a foot long. Cutting-teeth, which retain their sharpness
   by the same wonderful provision seen in the squirrel, enable him to mow
   as with a scythe the coarse, tough plants, aquatic roots, and grasses
   which are his food. A stomach capable of containing 5 or 6 bushels of
   vegetable matter prepares him to devour enormous quantities of herbage
   along river-margins and prove sadly destructive to neighboring crops.

   Though clumsy on the land, in the water the movements of the
   hippopotamus are often graceful and rapid. For the most part, he loves
   to lie ""in the covert of the reeds and fens,"" or float in the water
   with only his nostrils visible. By way of exercise, he walks at the
   bottom of the river or climbs the neighboring hillsides (""mountains"" of
   the Bible).

   ""The old commentators have made all sorts of conjectures on the
   behemoth. Some have maintained it was the elephant, others the wild
   buffalo, others the mammoth or some extinct pachyderm, others that it
   is a poetical description of these large creatures generally. But it
   appears clear that the description suits the hippopotamus exactly, and
   it alone; and this description has been adopted by Bochart and most
   modern critics. We know from the Egyptian monuments that this huge
   animal was hunted with spears; and noting its place in the description
   of the marvels of creation in Job, just before the leviathan or
   crocodile, the sequence seems to be that, powerful and terrible as is
   the hippopotamus, yet it may sometimes be taken with spears: 'But what
   canst thou do with the crocodile? Will spears and barbs avail against
   him?' "" -- Tristram.","",1

   2. King of Damascus, and a son of the preceding. 1 Kgs 20:1. He was
   engaged in numerous wars with Israel, and once was taken prisoner. 1
   Kgs 20. See Ahab. Afterward he declared war against Jehoram, king of
   Israel, but the prophet Elisha disclosed his plans so accurately that
   Jehoram was able to defeat them. 2 Kgs 6:8-33. It was Ben-hadad who
   sent Naaman to Elisha. 2 Kgs 5. See Elisha.

   In the siege of Samaria, which subsequently took place, that city was
   reduced to the greatest extremity. The Syrian army, under Ben-hadad,
   was lying around the walls, when in the course of the night they were
   led to conceive that they heard the noise of an immense army in motion.
   Supposing that the city had been succored by supplies of men and
   provisions from abroad, and terrified with the fancied tumult of their
   approach, the Syrians just at daybreak fled for their lives, leaving
   their camp, with all their horses, asses, provisions, utensils, etc.,
   just as they were, and their garments and vessels scattered all along
   the road by which they had fled. The citizens of Samaria were thus
   unexpectedly relieved and supplied with an abundance of food.

   The next year, Ben-hadad, being sick, sent Hazael to inquire of the
   prophet Elisha whether he would recover; and he received for answer
   that the king might certainly recover, and yet would surely die. Hazael
   also was informed by the prophet that he would be elevated to the
   throne of Syria, and would be guilty of enormous wickedness. The very
   next day Ben-hadad was murdered, and Hazael became king of Syria. 2 Kgs

   of calf-worship, 1 Kgs 12:29 2 Kgs 10:29; called Beth-aven -- i.e.
   ""house of idols,"" Hos 10:5, 1 Kgs 15:8; taken by Judah, 2 Chr 13:19;

   was desolate. Am 3:14; Am 5:5-6; settled by Benjamites after the
   Captivity, Neh 11:31; named about seventy times in the O.T.; not
   noticed in the N.T.; now called Beitin (9 miles south of Shiloh), a
   village of about 25 Moslem hovels, standing amid ruins which cover
   about 4 acres. Among the ruins is a Greek church, which appears to have
   been built out of the ruins of an older, and probably a Jewish,
   edifice. There are also the remains of a tower and a very large
   cistern. From the top of this ruined tower the Mount of Olives is
   distinctly visible, and Jewish tradition asserts, no doubt truthfully,
   that from the rival temple of Jeroboam idol priests could look down
   upon the temple of Solomon at Jerusalem. The spot is hallowed by
   Jacob's dream of a ladder which reached from earth to heaven, and
   caused him to exclaim, ""How dreadful is this place! this is none other
   but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."" Gen 28:17. 2. A

   miles south of Jerusalem, situated on a narrow ridge running eastward,
   which breaks down in abrupt terraced slopes to the deep valleys below.
   The town is 2527 feet above the sea. It is one of the oldest in
   Palestine.

   History. -- It was Rachel's burial-place (still marked by a white
   mosque near the town), and called Ephrath, Gen 35:19; the home of
   Naomi, Boaz, and Ruth, Ruth 1:19; birthplace of David, 1 Sam 17:12;
   burial-place of Joab's family, 2 Sam 2:32; taken by the Philistines,
   and had a noted well, 2 Sam 23:14-15; fortified by Rehoboam, 2 Chr
   11:6; foretold as the birthplace of Christ, Mic 5:2; the birthplace of
   Jesus, Matt 2:1; was visited by the shepherds, Luke 2:15-17, and by the
   magi, Matt 2:1-23. It is noticed over 40 times in the Bible.

   It has existed as a town for over 4000 years. It was a small place
   until after the time of Christ; was improved and its walls rebuilt by
   Justinian; had a famous church in a.d. 600; was destroyed by the Arabs,
   rebuilt by the Franks, again twice destroyed, a.d. 1214 and in 1489;
   rebuilt within the last two centuries; now has about 5000 inhabitants,
   nearly all nominally Christians, mostly of the Greek Church. The women
   of Bethlehem, as also those of Nazareth (the two homes of Christ), are
   exceptionally beautiful, and demonstrate the superiority of Christian
   women over Moslem women. It is now called Beit-Lahm; is surrounded by
   nicely kept terraces covered with vine, olive, and fig trees. The
   church of the Nativity, the oldest in Christendom, built in a.d. 330 by
   the empress Helena, stands over the grotto reputed to be the place of
   our Lord's birth, and is the joint property of the Greeks, Latins, and
   Armenians, who have separate convents adjoining it. The ""plain of the
   Shepherds"" is about a mile from the town. The so-called David's well is
   pointed out near the city. A massive column

   Bethlehem, (from Original Photograph by Bonfils.)

   stands upon the reputed spot where monkish legends say 20,000 martyred
   innocents were buried. The claim of these places as the true localities
   where the biblical events occurred rests wholly upon traditions covered
   with the accumulated rubbish of superstition, which render the
   identifications of small value. The chapel beneath the church, however,
   was the study of St. Jerome, where he spent thirty years on his great
   work, the Latin version of the Bible, called the Vulgate, and which is
   still the standard version in the Roman Church. The ""holy crypt,"" the
   reputed birthplace of our Lord, is a cave in the solid rock, twenty
   feet beneath the great choir of the church. At the entrance of a long
   winding passage cut out of the limestone rock is an irregular-shaped
   chapel, containing two small recesses. In the northernmost of these is
   a marble slab, on which a silver star marks the supposed spot of the
   Nativity. Hepworth Dixon (The Holy Land, 1865, ch. xiv.) not only
   accepts this cave as the birthplace of Jesus, but also tries to prove
   that it belonged to Boaz and was the home of David. The tradition that
   Jesus was born in this cave is very old, and is first mentioned by
   Justin Martyr (about a.d. 140), who was a native of Palestine. The
   precise place of our Saviour's birth, as that of his crucifixion, has
   been left in obscurity by a wise Providence. The greeting of Boaz to
   the reapers may still be heard in the fields of Bethlehem. The farmer
   now salutes his laborers with ""The Lord be with you!"" and they reply,
   as in the days of Ruth, ""The Lord bless thee!"" Ruth 2:4. 2. A town in

704,Bethsaida,"BETHSA'IDA (house of fishing), a city of Galilee, near Capernaum. John
   12:21; Matt 11:21. Many recent writers urge that there were two
   Bethsaidas, since the desert-place where the 5000 were fed belonged to
   ''the city called Bethsaida,"" Luke 9:10, while after the miracle the
   disciples were to go before him unto the other side to Bethsaida, Mark
   6:45, which it is said could not refer to the same town. 1. If there
   were two towns of this name, the first one, in Galilee, was on the west
   side of the lake. Robinson, Grove, Porter, and others place it at Ain
   et-Tabighak, north of Khan Minyeb, others at Khan Minyeh. 2. Bethsaida
   Julias, in Gaulanitis, on the eastern bank of the Jordan, near its
   entrance into the lake.

   But it seems quite unlikely that two cities in such close neighborhood
   should have borne the same name. Hence Dr. W. M. Thomson supposes that
   there was but one Bethsaida, which was built on both sides of the
   Jordan, and places the site at Abu-Zany, where the Jordan empties into
   the Lake of Galilee. The Sinaitic manuscript omits ""belonging to a city
   called Bethsaida"" in Luke 9:10; hence, Wilson also holds that there is
   no necessity for two Bethsaidas; and this seems the more probable view.
   The eastern part was beautified by Philip the tetrarch, and called
   Bethsaida Julias (in honor of a daughter of the emperor Augustus), to
   distinguish it from the western Bethsaida, in Galilee. --

   Among the Jews this relation was usually determined by the parents or
   brothers, without consulting the parties until they came to be
   betrothed. The engagement took place very early, though it was not
   consummated by actual marriage until the spouse was at least twelve
   years of age.

   The betrothing was performed a twelvemonth or more before the marriage,
   either in writing or by a piece of silver given to the espoused before
   witnesses. During the interval, however, from the time of espousals to
   the marriage, the woman was considered as the lawful wife of the man to

722,Bible,"BI'BLE ""The Holy Bible"" is the name given to the collection of books
   which contains the revelation of God in the creation, redemption, and
   sanctification of the world; a history of the past dealing of God with
   his people; a prophecy of coming events till the final consummation;
   and a living exhibition of saving truth in doctrine, precept, and
   example for all men and all time. The name is from the Greek (?ra.
   ^l^Ala?, ""the books""), and means the Book of books, the best of all
   books (so used since the fifth century in distinction from heretical
   and all uninspired writings). The collection is likewise spoken of as
   the ""Scriptures,"" ""the word of God."" The Bible embraces the work of
   about forty authors from all classes of society, from the shepherd to
   the king, living during an interval of sixteen hundred years, but all
   of the Hebrew extraction, with the single exception of Luke, whose
   Gospel, however, came from Jewish sources, and whose fame from his
   association with Paul. All forms of literary composition unite to give
   the Bible its unique interest, aside from its religious importance.
   These books, though differing in age, contents, and style, represent
   one and the same system of truth as revealed by God in its various
   aspects and adaptations to the existing wants and progressive
   understanding of his people. The Bible is not a book simply; it is an
   institution. It never grows old; it renews its youth with every age of
   humanity, and increases in interest and importance as history advances.
   It is to the Christian the only infallible source and rule of his faith
   and conduct; it is his daily bread of life, his faithful guide in holy
   living and dying, his best friend and companion -- far more precious
   than all other books combined. It is now more extensively studied than
   ever, and its readers will continue to multiply from day to day to all
   parts of the earth and to the end of time. Let us add some testimonies
   to its importance.

   The eloquent F. W. Robertson says: ""This collection of books has been
   to the world what no other book has ever been to a nation. States have
   been founded on its principles; kings rule by a compact based on it;
   men hold it in their hands when they give solemn evidence affecting
   death or property; the sick man is almost afraid to die unless the Book
   be within reach of his hands; the battle-ship goes into action with one
   on board whose office is to expound it; its prayers, its psalms, are
   the language we use when we speak to God; eighteen centuries have found
   no holier, no diviner language. The very translation of it has fixed
   language and settled the idioms of speech. It has made the most
   illiterate peasant more familiar with the history, customs, and
   geography of ancient Palestine than with the localities of his own
   country. . . . The orator holds a thousand men for half an hour
   breathless, a thousand men as one listening to his single word. But
   this word of God has held a thousand nations for thrice a thousand
   years spell-bound -- held them by an abiding power, even the
   universality of its truth; and we feel it to be no more a collection of
   books, but the Book."" The translators of the A. V., in their Address
   unto the Reader (reprinted in the Cambridge Paragraph Bible), say of
   the Bible: ""And what marvel? -- the original thereof being from heaven,
   not from earth; the author being God, not man; the inditer, the Holy
   Spirit, not the wit of the apostles or prophets; the penmen, such as
   were sanctified from the womb and endued with a principal portion of
   God's Spirit; the matter, verity, piety, purity, uprightness; the form,
   God's word, God's testimony, God's oracles, the word of truth, the word
   of salvation, etc.; the effects, light of understanding, stableness of
   persuasion, repentance from dead works, newness of life, holiness,
   peace, joy in the Holy Ghost; lastly, the end and reward of the study
   thereof, fellowship with the saints, participation of the heavenly
   nature, fruition of an inheritance immortal, undefiled, and that shall
   never fade away. Happy is the man that delighteth in the Scripture, and
   thrice happy that meditateth in it day and night!""

   The Bible is ordinarily divided into two parts, called the Old and New
   Testaments. But it would be more accurate to say ""the Old and New
   Covenants,"" inasmuch as ""testament"" implies the idea of a will and the
   death of the testator.

   In the present article the general questions in regard to the Bible
   will be discussed. The matters relating to the formation of the
   collection will be found under Canon, and the particulars of the
   different books under their respective names.

I. The Original Languages of the Bible.

    1. The O. T. is written in Hebrew, a Shemitic tongue, differing in
       most respects very widely from the Japhetic or Aryan languages, to
       which family ours belongs. The difference is not simply in
       vocabulary, but in grammatical structure, and also in the manner of
       writing, which is from right to left, giving rise to the common
       saying that Hebrew books begin at the last page. It is triliteral
       -- i. e. its words are built up according to certain rules from
       roots formed of three consonants. The verb has only two tenses, the
       perfect and the imperfect. There is no proper declension of nouns,
       and only two genders, masculine and feminine. There are three
       numbers, singular, dual, and plural. There are no compounds, in our
       sense of the term; the article, conjunction, and preposition,
       expressed each by a single consonant, are attached directly to the
       word. Pronouns undergo a similar treatment, ""whether they are the
       subject

   or object of verbs or dependent upon other forms of speech. Thus the
   Hebrew 'and from his land' is written as one word, though it embraces a
   conjunction, preposition, noun, and pronoun; but this is a mere
   aggregate, in which each element retains its separate force unchanged,
   not a compound, in which the several constituents combine in the
   expression of one idea."" -- Prof. W. H. Green. Hebrew is highly
   figurative -- pre-eminently fitted for devotion, but by lack of
   precision singularly unfitted for philosophy. It was therefore just the
   requisite medium for an introductory revelation. The O. T. does not
   argue against or analyze or defend any religion in set phrase, but it
   fills the mind with the knowledge of the true God and inspires the
   heart in his service.
    1. The N. T. was written in Greek, which had, since the Macedonian
       conquest of Alexander the Great, supplanted Hebrew in common use
       among the Jews who dwelt in the Roman provinces, and was the medium
       of communication between all parts of the civilized world. The
       ancient Greek literature is a perennial source of inspiration and
       knowledge. The language is at once vigorous and flexible, profound
       and clear, remarkably well suited to express every variety of
       thought. It is equally adapted to the concise, the critical, and
       the commonplace. In short, every order of mind can use it
       appropriately. It was in that day a better channel than the Hebrew
       for a divine revelation, and that of the highest kind. Hebrew no
       longer met the wants of culture. By nature it was hampered. It was
       the language of monotheism, but not of developed trinitarianism.

   The N. T. Greek is the Macedonian, and more particularly the
   Hellenistic, dialect, more or less mixed with Hebraisms, arising from
   the fact that the writers were Jews. In some books this tinge is very
   strong, especially in Matthew, Mark, and Revelation. On the contrary,
   the Greek of James and Luke, particularly in the preface of Luke's
   Gospel and in the latter part of the Acts, is good and forcible. Paul
   has a style of his own; broken and involved, interminable at times, as
   his sentences are, they are bold, pregnant, and lively. But whether
   with classical finish or unadorned simplicity, in this language the
   apostles addressed their own countrymen and the Gentiles upon the
   momentous truths and facts of the everlasting gospel.

   The Bible, like the Saviour whom it presents, is divine-human in its
   character. The written word became flesh, as well as the personal Word.
   The eternal truth of God passed through the mental faculties of the
   prophets and apostles, and uttered itself in human speech. Its contents
   were first in the mind, and then written out, either directly by the
   inspired man or at his dictation. The autographs have perished. We
   possess at best but copies of other copies. These, although made with
   reverent care, are not free from the imperfections of human writings.
   Errors would be perpetuated and new ones constantly made. This was
   pre-eminently the case with the N. T. The number of textual variations
   in the Greek N. T. or ""different readings,"" as they are called, amounts
   to 150,000. And yet we may claim that a special Providence has watched
   over the purity and integrity of the text of Holy Scripture, since only
   about 400 of these are of any consequence, the rest being trifles of
   spelling, etc., and none of these 400 affect a doctrine or precept.

   1 The Hebrew Bible of to-day is a reprint of the so-called Masoretic
   text -- i. e. the text punctuated and vocalized by a body of Jewish
   scholars who lived at Tiberias, and at Sora in the Euphrates valley,
   from the sixth to the twelfth century, and who committed to writing the
   mass of traditional notes of all kinds called the Masora -- i. e.
   tradition. Up to the beginning of that period the Hebrew text was
   written without ""points,"" as the vowel-points are called. These were
   added, and thus the pronunciation was fixed. By means of other marks
   punctuation and the tone-syllables were indicated. The separation of
   the text into verses by means of two dots arranged like a colon and the
   assortment of the books in a fixed order had been previously effected.
   It is stated that after the Masoretes had finished their labors all the
   manuscripts which had not this text were condemned as ""profane and
   illegitimate,"" which caused most of these rejected copies to perish.
   Thus the facts that there are very few old Hebrew manuscripts -- the
   oldest dating from the tenth century -- and that the same text is found
   in each, are accounted for. But happily for the scholars of Hebrew, the
   Masoretes marked their corrections upon the margin instead of inserting
   them in the text, and therefore they are at liberty to reject or use
   them.

   The Hebrew character has changed from an irregular to a square form.
   The Rabbins, however, in their books employed still another form, which
   is more cramped. The manuscripts whose use is obligatory in the
   synagogues to-day are written without punctuation-marks upon rolls, and
   are very carefully written and preserved.

   The whole Hebrew Bible was first printed in 1488; a second edition
   appeared in 1494. This was the one used by Luther. All subsequent
   Hebrew Bibles have been little more than reproductions of these two
   editions.

   2 The Greek New Testament. -- It is quite in keeping with the character
   of Christianity, which is free, active, bold, and progressive, that the
   little book upon which it rests for its initial history, its theology,
   and, to a certain extent, for its polity, should exhibit such diverse
   elements at work upon it, and likewise that the book itself should
   exist in so many more or less variant texts. Superstition, which
   secured the Jew a verbatim copy, as far as possible, of his sacred
   Scriptures, did not operate to anything like the same extent in the
   case of the Christians. They esteemed it a great privilege to have the
   Gospels and Epistles, but as copies multiply in the Church we find the
   thoughts of the inspired writer are better preserved than his exact
   words. At all events, the ""various readings"" increased. A very fruitful
   source of variation was the habit of writing at dictation, for a word
   incorrectly heard would be of course incorrectly written. Then, too,
   the use of ""ligatures,"" or combinations of letters, to save time, the
   arbitrary signs employed, and the marks of correction or doubt
   gradually worked into the text from the margin, each and all
   contributed to destroy the correctness of the copy. Superfluous words,
   filling out one sentence by piecing to it a part of another (e. g. Rom
   8:1 compared with Rom 8:4 shows conclusively that the latter clause of
   ver. 1 is repeated by inadvertence from ver. 4), marginal glosses which
   at last crept into the text, -- these are some of the unintentional
   faults of all copies. But these variations evince the lively interest
   which all classes took in the book, and therefore are an indirect proof
   of its divinity. They multiply the means for ascertaining the original
   reading and supersede the necessity of conjecture, to which we must
   often resort in the case of the ancient classics. So far from being
   alarmed at this state of things, we see in it the hand of God, who does
   not want his Church to be bound to the letter, but to be free in the
   Spirit, and to exercise all its powers of research upon his holy word.

   In the case of the N. T. the number of manuscripts is very large,
   considering the labor and expense of transcribing. They are divided
   into two classes: The uncials, which are written throughout in
   capitals, and with no division of words or of sentences, and with very
   few and simple marks of punctuation. The writing is in columns of
   uniform width, from one to four on a page, the letters filling out the
   page irrespective of the completion of a word. The material was
   parchment in book-form. The uncials go down to the tenth century. The
   most important uncial manuscripts are the Sinaitic of the fourth
   century (discovered by Prof. Tischendorf in the convent of St.
   Catherine, on Mount Sinai, 1859, and published in fac-simile, 1862),
   the Vatican of the same age (in the Vatican Library at Rome), and the
   somewhat later Alexandrian (in the British Museum, London). The second
   kind of manuscripts, the cursives, are so called because written in
   running-hand. The uncial form was, however, retained for some time
   after this in church copies. From about the eleventh century paper made
   from cotton or linen superseded parchment. The style of penmanship and
   other peculiarities in writing enable ""diplomatists,"" as such experts
   are called, to tell the century to which any given manuscript belongs.
   The later manuscripts are of little or no critical account since the
   discovery of the older or uncial manuscripts.

   The N. T. in Greek was first printed as part of the Complutensian
   Polyglot, which Cardinal Ximenes patronized, at Alcala, the modern name
   for the Spanish town Complutum, in 1514, but the Polyglot was not
   published till 1522. The editors, probably in their ignorance,
   pretended to have relied for the text upon very ancient manuscripts
   received from Rome; but as a matter of fact, the manuscripts were
   comparatively recent and very inaccurate. The first Greek Testament
   published was that of Erasmus, which appeared in 1516. The so-called
   ""Textus Receptus,"" or received text, is derived from the second edition
   of Elzevir, published at Leyden, 1633. It is in the main a copy of
   Beza's (1565-1589). The typographical beauty of the Elzevir edition and
   its handy shape, and not its critical merit, determined its acceptance.
   In England the text of Stephens (1550), which is substantially the same
   with the text of Elzevir, has often been reprinted and taken as the
   basis of critical editions from Mills down to Tregelles, although
   Bentley suggested a new basis from the oldest sources. The text of the
   N. T. has been brought into its present satisfactory condition after
   long-continued and patient study, and every Bible student should thank
   God for the scholars he has raised up to do this work. All honor to the
   immortal names of Griesbach (1754-1812), Lachmann (1793-1851),
   Tischendorf (1815-1874), Tregelles (1813-1875), Westcott, and Hort, for
   to them are we indebted for the oldest and purest text of the Greek
   Testament which can be attained at the present day, and which makes a
   revision of our English version at once desirable and safe.

III. The Order of the Books and the Names of their Divisions.

   1 The Old Testament. -- The Jewish arrangement differs widely from
   ours. The N. T. recognizes a division of the O. into ""the Law and the
   Prophets,"" Matt 11:13; Matt 22:40; Acts 13:15, etc., which phrase was
   doubtless a popular way of speaking of the whole book. We also find a
   longer phrase, ""the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms,"" Luke 24:44. The
   Jews divided their sacred Scriptures into (a) the Law -- i. e. the five
   books of Moses, commonly known as the Pentateuch, the five-fold book;
   (b) the Prophets, divided into the earlier, including Joshua, Judges,
   First and Second Samuel, First and Second Kings, and later, which are
   subdivided into the greater -- Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel -- and the
   twelve so-called minor prophets; (c) The Holy Writings, or Hagiographa,
   as they are usually denominated, comprising the Psalms, Proverbs, Job,
   Canticles, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra,
   Nehemiah, First and Second Chronicles. In this probably chronological
   order the books are arranged in the Hebrew Bibles.

   The Christian division into historical, poetical, and prophetical books
   is topical and more appropriate. It is not necessary to enumerate the
   books, as a full list is appended to almost every copy of the Bible.

   2 The New Testament is divided into the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles,
   the Epistles, both Pauline and Catholic (the latter -- those of James,
   Peter, John, and Jude -- so called because not addressed to particular
   churches or individuals, but of universal import), and the Revelation;
   or more briefly into the historical, the doctrinal, and the prophetical
   books. The oldest manuscripts vary in their arrangement. Many put the
   Catholic Epistles immediately after the Acts, while the Sinaitic puts
   the Pauline Epistles before the Acts.

IV. The Division of the Text into Chapters and Verses.

   The ancient mode of writing was continuous; no stops of any kind were
   made, nor were words separated. See article Book. As soon as any break
   is made we get the germs of a system of division, for these breaks will
   indicate punctuation, and thus serve the secondary purpose of
   facilitating reference and remembrance. We find that the division of
   the sacred text into sections was early made as a matter of necessity,
   but that chapters and verses were of much later origin.

   1 The Old Testament. -- The Rabbinic

   Specimens of existing MSS. of the Scriptures.

   4th Cent. Codex Sinaiticus. -- 1 Tim. iii. 16.

   to tes eusebeias | musterion [the late corr.] os e.

   4th Cent. Codex Sinaiticus. -- John i. 18.

   nogenes th(eo)s [o on corr.] eis ton.

   4th Cent. Codex Vaticanus. -- Mark xvi. 8.

   stasis kai oudeni ou | den eipan ephoboun | to gar:

   5th Cent. Codex Alexandrinus. -- John i. 1.

   en arche en o logos kai o logos en | pros ton th(eo)n kai th(eo)s en o
   logos

   10th Cent. Codex Basiliensis, known to Erasmus, but little used by him.

   -Luke i. 1-2 nearly, as in all Greek Testaments. division is very
   elaborate. It originated in the liturgical use in worship; and so, the
   more the books were used, the more complete was the notation. The N. T.
   quotations from the O. T. for the most part are cited with no more
   specific reference than to the book from which they come, but sometimes
   in other ways: thus, ""the bush "" quoted from in Mark 12:26 and Luke
   20:37 was a familiar section of our present Exodus, and was only one of
   similar terms for other parts. In like manner, the existence of a cycle
   of lessons is indicated by Luke 4:17; Acts 13:15; Acts 15:21; 2 Cor
   3:14, and this, whether identical or not with the later Rabbinic cycle,
   must have involved an analogous arrangement to that subsequently
   adopted. Prof. Plumptre, in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible says:""The
   Law was divided first, much later the Prophets; the former into
   fifty-four sections, to correspond with the number of Sabbaths in the
   Jewish intercalary year. But these sections were subdivided to fit them
   for reading by different persons in the synagogue service. The Prophets
   were not so uniformly nor so imperatively divided. Yet in intention
   these sections corresponded to the sections of the Law, so that they
   together constitute a 'table of lessons' for Sabbath public use. Some
   time in the ninth century a.d. the sections were divided into verses.""

   2 The New Testament. -- The Gospels were divided first about the middle
   of the third century (a.d. 220), by Ammonius of Alexandria, into short
   chapters, ""constructed to facilitate the comparison of corresponding
   passages of the several Gospels."" Later on the Acts, the Pauline and
   the Catholic Epistles, and finally, about a.d. 500, the Revelation,
   were thrown into chapters.

   Our present division of all the books in the Bible into chapters is
   much later, dating from Cardinal Hugo de St. Cher (died 1263), whose
   Concordance to the Vulgate popularized the use of verses likewise. This
   division was introduced into the Latin Bible, and afterward into the
   Greek O. T.

   The present system of verses was prepared and introduced by Robert
   Stephens in his Greek Testament, 1551.

   While both these divisions are on the whole well made, there are
   numerous places where correction is loudly demanded; chapters begin in
   wrong places, and verses end in the midst of a sentence. These
   divisions are at best necessary evils. The reading of the Bible is
   interrupted by them, owing to the practice of ending with a chapter.
   Paragraph Bibles are to be commended, because in them the sections are
   arranged according to the writer's thought, irrespective of the
   chapters, and the verses are merely indicated by numbers on the margin.
   No verses are marked in Tyndale, Coverdale, or the Great Bible.

V. The Translations of the Bible.

        1. Ancient Translations.

   (a) Into Chaldee. -- Since the Jews, during the Captivity, had lost
   command over Hebrew, it became necessary to translate the sacred books
   into their vernacular, the Chaldee. We find a reference to this state
   of things in Neh 8:8. These Chaldee translations and paraphrases are
   called Targums (the word means interpretation), but there is no one
   which comprises the whole O. T.

   (b) Into Greek. -- The best known is called the Septuagint, and is
   commonly represented in scholarly books by the Roman numerals LXX. It
   was made direct from the Hebrew by a company of learned Alexandrian
   Jews in that city under the patronage of Ptolemy Philadelphus, and
   begun b.c. 285. It is not of equal fidelity throughout. The name
   Septuagint -- i. e. seventy, a round number for the more exact
   seventy-two -- arose from a tradition that the work was executed in
   seventy-two days by seventy-two Jewish scholars. The version was made
   from Egyptian Hebrew manuscripts, and probably at different times,
   which may account for the inequality. As it now stands, it includes the
   Apocrypha, but did not at the beginning. Those books were gradually
   added. The LXX. has exerted great influence, was claimed by the Jews to
   be inspired, was in universal use among them in Christ's day, is
   continually quoted by the N. T. writers and by the Greek Fathers, was
   translated instead of the Hebrew into Latin, and is the authority in
   the Greek Church to-day. When the Christians in debate quoted it
   against their Jewish adversaries, the latter awoke to the fact that
   their own regard for it was excessive, and therefore abandoned it and
   returned to the study and use of the original Hebrew. Though not
   literal, and perhaps intentionally so, it is very valuable in
   explaining the Hebrew text. Other Greek translations were made by
   Aquila, Theodotion, and Symmachus, but they exist only in fragments.

   (c) Into Siriac. -- A translation into this language, made by
   Christians, direct from the Hebrew, called the Peshito (simple, because
   it was literal, and not paraphrastic), was in common use in the fourth
   century, but probably dates from the latter part of the second. It is
   the earliest of these direct versions.

   (d) Into Latin. -- The one called the Itala, made from the Septuagint,
   existed very early in the Latin Church. But the one which is now the
   ""authorized version "" in the Church of Rome was made by Jerome, the
   most learned Christian of his day, directly from the Hebrew, a.d.
   385-405. It is called the Vulgate, and was declared by the Council of
   Trent (1563) to be of equal authority with the original Bible. All
   Roman Catholic versions must be conformed to it.

   It was very natural that the first book printed was the Bible.
   Gutenberg, the inventor of the art of printing, turned his skill unto
   the service of God (1450-55). Before discussing other versions,we quote
   a few lines upon pre-Reformation Bibles: ""The earliest printed Bibles
   in the modern European languages were the first and second German
   Bibles by Mentelin and Eggesteyn of Strasburg, of rather uncertain
   date, but certainly not later than 1466. In 1471 appeared at Venice two
   translations into Italian -- the one by Malermi, printed by Vindelin de
   Spira, and the other by Nicolas Jenson. In 1477 was printed the first
   N. T. in French, by Buyer, at Lyons, and the same year appeared the
   first edition of the O. T. in Dutch, printed at Delft by Jacob Jacobs
   zoen and Mauritius Yemants zoen. In 1480 was published the splendid
   Bible in the Saxon or Low German language, from the press of Heinrich
   Quental, of Cologne, followed by a second edition in 1491, and a third
   in 1494. The Psalms, in Dutch, first came out in 1480, in small octavo,
   and in Greek and Latin in 1481, while the first Hebrew Pentateuch
   appeared in 1482. The entire Bible, done into French paraphrase, was
   published by Guyard de Moulins in 1487. A full translation appeared in
   the Bohemian language, printed at Prague in 1488. The same year
   appeared the entire O. T. in Hebrew from the press of Abraham ben
   Chayim de'Tintori, at Soncino. This chronological arrangement shows us
   also many noteworthy points, such as that nearly all the earliest
   Bibles were huge folios; that the first Bibles printed at Rome and
   Venice appeared in 1471, and that the sixth German Bible, by G. Zainer,
   in 1475, at Augsburg, was the first with the leaves folioed or
   numbered; that the first quarto Bible appeared in 1475, printed by John
   Peter de Ferratis at Placentia, which also was the first book printed
   at Placentia; that the first of Coburger's celebrated Bibles appeared
   in Nuremberg in 1475, and that by the end of the century no less than
   thirteen large folio Bibles had come from this house alone; that the
   four splendid Bibles printed in 1476 all bear the printers' signatures,
   though it is difficult to say with certainty which was the first; that
   the first Bible with a distinct title-page was printed at Venice, by
   George de Ravabenis, in 1487, in small quarto, and that the first Bible
   in small octavo -- or the poor man's Bible -- was the earliest, or
   among the earliest books, from the press of Johann Froben, of Basle, in
   1491. ""Prior to the discovery of America no less than twelve grand
   patriarchal editions of the entire Bible, being of several different
   translations, appeared from time to time in the German language; to
   which add the two editions by the Otmars of Augsburg of 1507 and 1518,
   and we have the total number of no less than fourteen distinct large
   folio pre-Reformation or ante-Lutheran Bibles. No other language except
   the Latin can boast of anything like this number."" -- Henry Stevens:
   Bibles in the Caxton Exhibition, pp. 27, 28.

   Thus, prior to the Reformation, there were translations of the entire
   Bible into the principal languages. Still, their unwieldy size and
   great cost kept them from popular use, although, more than is commonly
   supposed, they carried a knowledge of the Word unto the common people,
   and thus prepared the way for better things. These several translations
   were from the Vulgate; those now to be very briefly mentioned were made
   after the Reformation, and from the original tongues.

        2. *Modern Translations.*

   (a) Into German. -- We have already seen that there were fourteen
   editions of the entire Bible printed and circulated in Germany before
   Luther (1483-1546) nailed his theses upon the church-door at
   Wittenberg, Oct. 31, 1517. But to the great Reformer is due the credit
   of translating the entire Bible, together with the Apocrypha, out of
   the original tongues. He conceived the idea, and carried it out by
   translating the N. T. while in friendly captivity in the Wartburg
   during 1521. He published the work in the fall of 1522. Then he began
   at the O. T., and published the translation in sections as he advanced.
   The first edition of the entire Bible appeared in 1534. Ten editions of
   the original version were printed. In 1541 he issued an edition in
   which the first had been faithfully revised by his colleagues and
   himself. This translation is that used in Germany to-day. It has often
   been remarked that it fixed the German language and at the same time
   established Protestantism.

   (b) Into French. -- A French version by Le Fevre was published at
   Antwerp in 1530. But there is no national French version; that which
   comes nearest to it is Olivetan's, which, however, is sadly defective,
   though improved by Calvin, his cousin. This version appeared in 1535 in
   the village of Serrieres, near Neufchatel, at the expense of the
   Waldenses. Of existing versions, Segond's (1880) is by far the best.

   (c) Into Dutch. -- The States-general's translation, ordered by the
   Synod of Dort (1619), is reputed the most accurate of all present
   modern versions.

   (d) Into English. -- The story of the English Bible begins before the
   Reformation.

   (1.) John de Wycliffe (about 1324-84), aided by Hereford, was the first
   to translate the entire Bible into English. The greater part of the
   translation of the N. T. was made by him; this appeared in 1381. The O.
   T. was principally the work of Nicholas de Hereford, but Wycliffe
   finished it. Manuscript copies were multiplied. Many poor priests went
   through the country preaching from this version. The first true text
   was not brought out in print before 1850, in the edition of Forshall
   and Madden, in 4 vols. (The earliest printed editions of the N. T. by
   Baber and in Bagster's English Hexupla are not the version of Wycliffe,
   but of one of his followers).

   Wycliffe simply translated from the Vulgate, and hence there was need
   of a new and independent version. Besides, the change in the language
   required it. The invention of printing rendered it possible to give the
   Bible in the vernacular to the masses, but the Roman Church has never
   been favorable to this, knowing full well that Bible study means
   independent research and protest against unscriptural traditions. It
   was not until the gathering storm of the Reformation burst upon the
   deformed and diseased Roman communion that the English people received
   a translation from the original languages of the entire Bible.

   (2.) For doing this the credit belongs to William Tyndale (born 1484),
   who was burnt at the stake, a martyr to the cause of religious liberty,
   Oct. 6, 1536; but not before he had by his work won an imperishable
   fame. Filled with the one wish, which he lived to realize -- to give
   every one who could read English the opportunity of reading for himself
   God's holy word -- he endured the contradiction of sinners against
   himself. Understanding, as he says, ""that there was no place to
   translate the N. T. in all England,"" he went to Europe in 1524, and
   carried on his work amid every sort of difficulty and danger. The N. T.
   appeared at Worms in the latter part of 1525, and arrived in England
   the early part of 1526, where it was extensively circulated. Tyndale
   revised it, and published in this enforced and stealthy way several
   editions under his personal supervision. He also issued at intervals
   various books of the O. T., and the manuscript translation of other
   parts was just before his death transmitted to Thomas Poynitz of
   Antwerp, who finally delivered them to John Rogers (alias Thomas
   Matthew), who subsequently edited them.

   (3.) Miles Coverdale (1488-1569) is the next name upon the list. He
   differed greatly from his predecessor, Tyndale, lacking his
   independence and devotion and his knowledge of the original languages,
   yet on the whole he deserves well of posterity. His translation of the
   entire Bible appeared Oct. 4, 1535, prefaced by a fulsome dedication to
   the king, Henry VIII. In order to render the volume more attractive, it
   was illustrated with several wood-cuts. It was avowedly not made from
   the original tongues, but from three Latin and two German translations
   (viz. the Vulgate, Erasmus, Pagninus, Luther, and Leo Judii). The O. T.
   was based chiefly on the Swiss-German (Zurich) Bible, and the N. T. on
   Tyndale, although with many variations. It was printed in Antwerp at
   the expense of Jacob van Meteren, [1] but published in London. This
   translation had but little influence upon the so-called A. V.

   (4.) The ""Thomas Matthew"" Bible was a compilation, although not a
   mechanical one, under this assumed name, made by John Rogers (1505-55),
   Tyndale's friend, who is famous as the first Marian martyr, burnt at
   Smithfield, Feb. 4, 1555, from the above-mentioned translations of
   Tyndale and Coverdale. It was published in London, 1537, but probably
   printed by Jacob van Meteren in Antwerp [2] . The publishers, Messrs.
   Grafton & Whitechurch, in some way interested Archbishop Cranmer in
   this edition, who through Crumwell procured a royal license for it, and
   this Bible became the first authorized version. And so it came about
   that this edition of the Bible, which was two thirds Tyndale's
   translation, ""that had been again and again publicly stigmatized and
   condemned by authority of this same king, Henry VIII., and even
   actually prohibited seven years before, was now 'set forth with the
   king's most gracious license,' this authorization being printed in red
   ink in each separate volume."" Appended to the chapters are notes; upon
   this part the editor laid out his strength.

   (5.) Richard Tavener (1505-1575) issued a revised edition of the
   Matthew Bible in 1539, but it never was widely used. Its sale may have
   been stopped by the publication of the so-called Great Bible.

   (6.) The ""Great Bible,"" sometimes called Whitechurch's, after one of
   the printers' names, or oftener ""Cranmer's Bible,"" from the mistaken
   idea that he was the editor of it, was published in London, 1539. Its
   name came from its size; its pages are fully 15 inches in length and
   over 9 in breadth. Its text is Matthew's, revised by Coverdale, who in
   his singular humility thus revised his own work. To Crumwell's
   Protestant zeal and triumphant energy do we owe the volume. It was
   devoid of notes. It was the first edition which printed in a different
   type the words not found in the original. It also derives interest from
   the fact that the Scripture sentences in the English Prayer-book in the
   Communion Service, in the Homilies, and the entire Psalter are taken
   from it. In 1540 appeared the Cranmer Bible, so called from the
   archbishop's prologue, but in fact only a new revised edition of the
   Great Bible of the previous year.

   (7.) The Geneva Version (1560), made by the refugees from the Marian
   persecution, principally by William Whittingham (1524-89), whose wife
   was Calvin's sister. But the Genevan Bible must not be confounded with
   the New Testament which appeared there in June, 1557, the fruit of the
   editorial labors of Whittingham. The Genevan Bible was begun the
   January following. The N. T. had for the first time the division of
   verses (following the Greek of Stephens, 1551), with the numbers
   prefixed. It had also characteristic marginal notes, and marks by
   italics the words supplied. The Genevan Bible, having been begun, was
   carried resolutely through. It is not known how many were engaged upon
   it, but a large share of the work fell upon Whittingham, who tarried in
   Geneva along with Gilby and Sampson a year and a half after Queen
   Elizabeth's accession in order to complete the work begun during the
   dark days of ''Bloody Mary."" The Bible finally appeared April, 1560,
   with a dedication to the queen. The translation is careful and
   scholarly work, based chiefly upon Tyndale and Cranmer, with many
   proofs of the influence of Beza. It is really the first complete direct
   English translation from the original Hebrew and Greek Scriptures. It
   at once became widely popular. ""It was printed in Roman characters,
   with division into chapters and verses. It was not a heavy, unhandy
   folio like the editions of Coverdale, Rogers, or the Great Bible, but a
   moderate and manageable quarto. Its marginal notes were a kind of
   running comment, vigorous and lucid, dogmatic and practical. ... It
   became at once the people's book in England and Scotland, and it held
   its place not only during the time of the Bishops' Bible, but even
   against the present A. V. for at least thirty years. It was the first
   Bible ever printed in Scotland (1576-79), and it was the cherished
   volume in all Covenanting and Puritan households."" -- Eadie:The English
   Bible, vol. ii. p. 16.

   (8.) The Bishops' Bible. -- In the early part of Queen Elizabeth's
   reign the Great Bible was allowed to be read in the churches as the
   authorized version, but the Genevan edition was a formidable rival,
   greatly excelling it in popularity and, besides, in accuracy. Thus it
   came about that a revision was demanded, and this Archbishop Parker
   (1504--75) was anxious to make. He began it about 1563-64, having
   distributed the work to 15 scholars, 8 of whom were bishops, and
   therefore the Bible was called ""The Bishops' Bible,"" and the book was
   published in 1568. It contained no word of flattery, nor even a
   dedication, but was ornamented with 143 copper-plate engravings of
   maps, portraits, coats of arms, etc.; it also had notes, brief but
   valuable, generally on matters of interpretation, but occasionally
   dogmatic. It was a revision of the Great Bible, which in turn was based
   on ""Matthew's"" recension of Tyndale. An effort was made to secure for
   the Bishops' Bible the royal sanction, but ineffectually. Convocation,
   however, passed a decree in 1571 ""that every archbishop and bishop
   should have at his house a copy of the Holy Bible of the largest volume
   as lately printed in London, and that it should be placed in the hall
   or large dining room, that it might be useful to their servants or to
   strangers."" The order applied to each cathedral, and, ""so far as could
   be conveniently done, to all the churches."" The Bishops' Bible
   supplanted the Great Bible, but could not the Genevan, because that was
   wide-spread among the people. The most important fact in its history is
   that it was made the basis for the recension which resulted in our
   present A. V.

   (9.) Roman Catholic Translations. -- The Roman Church has never been
   friendly to vernacular translations of the Scriptures. Hence we should
   not expect it would spontaneously make one; but when the Genevan
   version became so popular in England, it seemed desirable that, since
   English Roman Catholics were sure to fall in with it, they should be
   given a corrective in the shape of a translation by some of the
   faithful. The N. T. appeared at Rheims, in France, in 1582, and the O.
   T. at Douai (1609-10), although it had been prepared before the
   appearance of the N. T., but delayed for lack of means. The first
   complete edition of the entire Bible according to this recension was
   published at Rouen (1633-35). Its translators were good scholars, but
   were obliged to take the Latin Vulgate as the basis, and to adhere very
   closely to it. They accompanied the translation with polemical notes.
   On the whole, the work is inferior to our version, and disfigured by
   unintelligible Latinisms. No effort was made to give this translation
   any circulation. It was issued in an expensive form, and none of the
   Church dignitaries concerned themselves with it. Cardinal Wiseman
   (Essays, vol. i. pp. 73-75) says:""To call the Roman Catholic version
   now in use the version of Rheims and Douai is an abuse of terms. It has
   been altered and modified till scarcely any verse remains as it was
   originally published; and so far as simplicity and energy of style are
   concerned, the changes are in general for the worse."" The revision was
   chiefly made by Dr. Challoner (1750) and by Dr. Troy (1791). The
   Catholic version has retained from the Vulgate some of the oldest and
   best readings and a large number of Latinisms, some good (as advent,
   victim, allegory, prevarication, altercation, fallacy), others which
   have never gone into public use (as azyntes, corhana, parasceve,
   consubstantial, coinquination, scenopegia). It has contributed some
   improvements to King James's revisers. See examples in Moulton's
   History of the English Bible, p. 187 (London, 1878). ""Nothing is
   easier,"" says Dr. Moulton, "" than to accumulate instances of the
   eccentricity of this revision, of its obscure and inflated renderings;
   but only minute study can do justice to its faithfulness and to the
   care with which the translators executed their work.""

   (10.) The King James's Version (1611). -- The final outcome of this
   series of original translations and revisions of translations of the
   Scriptures was the so called A. V., which for 250 years has been the
   channel whereby God's truth has flowed into Anglo-Saxon minds. But it
   has been even an instructor in other things than those of religion, for
   from it the language has drawn its stability. Its style is regarded
   with admiration by natives and foreigners alike. It is the first of
   English classics. Even seceders to Rome admit this, as the sweet and
   fervent hymnist, Dr. F. William Faber, whose remarkable judgment (often
   falsely attributed to Dr. John Henry Newman) is well worth quoting in
   full: ""Who will say that the uncommon beauty and marvellous English of
   the Protestant Bible is not one of the great strongholds of heresy in
   this country? It lives on the ear like a music that can never be
   forgotten, like the sound of church-bells, which the convert hardly
   knows how he can forego. Its felicities often seem to be almost things
   rather than mere words. It is part of the national mind and the anchor
   of national seriousness. Nay, it is worshipped with a positive
   idolatry, in extenuation of whose grotesque fanaticism its intrinsic
   beauty pleads availingly with the man of letters and the scholar. The
   memory of the dead passes into it. The potent traditions of childhood
   are stereotyped in its verses. The power of all the griefs and trials
   of a man is hidden beneath its words. It is the representative of his
   best moments; and all that there has been about him of soft, and
   gentle, and pure, and penitent, and good speaks to him for ever out of
   his English Bible. It is his sacred thing, which doubt has never
   dimmed, and controversy never soiled. It has been to him all along as
   the silent -- but oh how intelligible ! -- voice of his guardian angel,
   and in the length and breadth of the land there is not a Protestant,
   with one spark of religiousness about him, whose spiritual biography is
   not in his Saxon Bible. And all this is an unhallowed power!""

   The A. V. is a monument to the memory of King James I. of England, but
   he had no more to do with it than to appoint the commission, and did
   not contribute a penny for its execution. It was abruptly proposed in
   the Hampton Court Conference (Jan., 1604) by a learned Puritan divine,
   the Rev. Dr. Reynolds (1549-1607), president of Corpus Christi College,
   Oxford, who suggested to His Majesty ""that there might be a new
   translation of the Bible, because those which were allowed in the reign
   of King Henry VIII. and Edward VI. were corrupt and not answerable to
   the truth of the original."" Bishop Bancroft opposed the motion as
   impertinent, but the vain king, who thought himself as wise as Solomon,
   unexpectedly and at once agreed to it, and displayed his biblical
   erudition by criticising the previous translations, especially that of
   Geneva, which he hated on account of its marginal notes. He invited a
   number of distinguished scholars to do the work (June 30, 1604), but
   without any expense to himself. Professing his own poverty, he held out
   before the revisers the hope of Church preferment, giving orders to the
   bishops to that effect, and for their immediate expenses he called upon
   the bishops and chapters to contribute toward the requisite amount.
   Revision had no attractions for the clergy nor for the people. The
   Bishops' and Geneva Bibles already in their hands seemed to answer
   every purpose. Accordingly, as far as can be determined, no one
   responded to the king's call for money; yet since the whole amount was
   only about £700, the proportion from each diocese was really small.
   ""King James's version never cost King James a farthing."" At the
   chancellor's suggestion, the revisers met at the universities, where
   they received board and lodging free of cost; and ""at the final
   revision the 6 or 12 revisers received each, according to one
   statement, 20 shillings a week from the Company of Stationers."" The
   work of revision thus arranged in the summer of 1604 was not really
   begun in earnest till the spring of 1607, and then occupied about 2
   years and 9 months. Dr. Reynolds, who had proposed the work, and who
   was well qualified to carry it on, died in that year, just as his wish
   was to be gratified. The original number of revisers appointed by the
   king at the suggestion of some one unknown, but probably Richard
   Bancroft (1544-1610), then the bishop of London, soon afterward the
   archbishop of Canterbury, was 54, but owing to death, declinature, and
   other causes there were only 47 actually engaged. These 47 formed
   themselves into 6 companies, two meeting at Westminster, Cambridge, and
   Oxford respectively. The following are the rules which were composed to
   govern them in their labors:

   ""(1.) The ordinary Bible read in the Church, commonly called 'The
   Bishops' Bible,' to be followed, and as little altered as the truth of
   the original will permit.

   ""(2.) The names of the prophets and the holy writers, with tiie other
   names of the text, to be retained as nigh as may be, accordingly as
   they were vulgarly used.

   "" (3.) The old ecclesiastical words to be kept; viz.:the word church
   not to be translated congregation, etc.

   ""(4.) When a word hath divers significations, that to be kept which
   hath been most commonly used by the most ancient fathers, being
   agreeable to the propriety of the place and the analogy of the faith.

   ""(5.) The division of the chapters to be altered either not at all or
   as little as may be, if necessity so require.

   "" (6.) No marginal notes at all to be affixed, but only for the
   explanation of the Hebrew or Greek words which cannot, without some
   circumlocution, so briefly and fitly be preserved in the text.

   ""(7.) Such quotations of places to be originally set down as shall
   serve for the fit reference of one Scripture to another.

   ""(8.) Every particular man of each company to take the same chapter or
   chapters; and having translated or amended them severally by himself
   where he thinketh good, all to meet together, confer what they have
   done, and agree for their parts what shall stand.

   ""(9.) As any one company hath despatched any one book in this manner,
   they shall send to the rest to be considered of seriously and
   judiciously; for His Majesty is very careful in this point.

   ""(10.) If any company, upon the review of the book so sent, doubt or
   differ upon any place, to send then) word thereof, note the place, and
   withal send the reasons; to which if they consent not, the difference
   to be compounded at the general meeting, which is to be of the chief
   persons of each company at the end of the work.

   ""(11.) When any place of special obscurity is doubted of, letters to be
   directed by authority to send to any learned man in the land for his
   judgment of such a place.

   ""(12.) Letters to be sent from every bishop to the rest of his clergy,
   admonishing them of this translation in hand, and to move and charge as
   many as being skilful in the tongues, and having taken pains in that
   kind, to send his particular observations to the company either at
   Westminster, Cambridge, or Oxford.

   ""(13.) The directors in each company to be the deans of Westminster and
   Chester for that place, and the king's professors of Hebrew and Greek
   in either university.

   ""(14.) These translations to be used when they agree better with the
   text than the Bishops' Bible: Tindale's, Matthew's [Rogers'],
   Coverdale's, Whitchurch's [Cranmer's], Geneva.

   ""(15.) Besides the said directors before mentioned, three or four of
   the most ancient and grave divines in either of the universities, not
   employed in translating, to be assigned by the vice-chancellor, upon
   conference with the rest of the heads, to be overseers of the
   translations, as well Hebrew as Greek, for the better observation of
   the fourth rule above specified."" How closely these rules were followed
   it is impossible to say. The secrets of their sessions have been
   inviolably kept; for although the translators were engaged for 3 years,
   of the incidents of their labor little can be gathered from
   contemporaneous history, and little was probably known beyond the
   circle of the translators. A passing remark of Selden furnishes nearly
   all that can now be known of what may be termed the private history of
   our English Bible:""The translation in King James's time took an
   excellent way. That part of the Bible was given to him who was most
   excellent in such a tongue, and then they met together, and one read
   the translation, the rest holding in their hands some Bible, either of
   the learned tongues, or French, Spanish, Italian, etc. If they found
   any fault, they spoke; if not, he read on."" -- Table Talk. When the
   revision was completed, three copies of the whole Bible were sent [to
   London] -- one from Cambridge, a second from Oxford, and a third from
   Westminster -- where they were committed to six persons, two from each
   company, who reviewed the whole. This final revision lasted 9 months.
   The work was at last given up to the printer, Robert Barker; the proofs
   were read by Dr. Thomas Bilson, bishop of Winchester, and Dr. Myles
   Smith (appointed bishop of Gloucester in 1612).

   The first edition of the A. V., including the Apocrypha, appeared,
   bearing date 1611, in handsome folio, in black letter, with a beautiful
   frontispiece engraved by C. Boel of Richmont. Besides the translation,
   there were given a Calendar, a Table of Lessons, and elaborate Tables
   of Genealogies. The dedication was fulsome in its praise of James. The
   preface, entitled ""The Translators to the Reader,"" written by Dr. Myles
   Smith, is pedantic, according to our notions, but written in excellent
   English, and important as a clear statement of the principles upon
   which the revision was made. The title-page contained the words
   ''Appointed to be read in the churches "" -- i. e. of England. But there
   is no evidence that this appointment was ever made by convocation or
   Parliament, privy council or the king. The version ""gained currency
   partly by the weight of the king's name, partly by the personal
   authority of the prelates and scholars who had been engaged upon it,
   but still more by its own intrinsic superiority over its rivals."" --
   Westcott. The printing of the so-called A. V. at once stopped the
   printing of the Bishops' Bible, though it did not that of the Genevan
   Bible, which continued to be used, especially in New England, until
   about the middle of the seventeenth century, when King James's version
   was on all hands accepted as the English Bible.

   ""When all critical helps and sources of influence have been taken into
   account, the student whose analysis [of the A. V.] has been most
   complete will find most to admire in the work that the translation or
   revision of 1607-11 has given us. The praise he will award to the
   revisers will not be indiscriminate eulogy. He will discover that very
   much that they have transmitted to us was inherited by them from
   others; the execution of different parts of the work will prove to be
   unequal, the Epistles, for example, standing far below the Pentateuch
   in accuracy and felicity of rendering; many flaws and inconsistencies
   will reveal themselves; occasionally it will be found that better
   renderings have been deliberately laid aside, and worse preferred; but,
   notwithstanding, almost every paragraph will bear testimony to the
   tact, care, diligence, and faithfulness of the men to whom, in God's
   providence, we owe the version of the Scriptures which has come down to
   us consecrated by the associations of 250 years."" -- Moulton:History of
   the English Bible, pp. 207-8.

   The modern edition of the English Bible is a great improvement upon
   that of 1611. In that year there were two issues, both incorrectly
   printed, and both containing errors which were not typographical. Much
   care has been taken since that date to make the version, in grammatical
   and typographical correctness, as nearly perfect as possible. Three
   editions of the A. V. deserve particular mention: (1.) Bishop Lloyd's
   (London, 1701), containing, for the first time, marginal dates, derived
   principally from Archbishop Ussher; (2.) the Cambridge Bible of 1762,
   edited by Dr. Paris; (3.) the Oxford edition of 1769, edited by Dr.
   Blayney. ''These editors sought to apply with greater consistency the
   principle of denoting additions to the original text by italic type,
   substituted ordinary forms of words for such as had, in their opinion,
   become obsolete, and made very large additions to the number of
   marginal references, which in our present Bible are said to be seven
   times as numerous as in the edition of 1611.... [But] as late as 1830,
   Bibles were often printed with serious want of accuracy. The last forty
   years have witnessed a considerable improvement, and recent editions
   have left little to be desired. The Cambridge Paragraph Bible, edited
   by Dr. Scrivener, is the classic edition of the A. V., and is a
   monument of minute accuracy and unsparing labor."" -- Moulton:History of
   the Engish Bible, pp. 209-11. In the Jubilee Memorial of the American
   Bible Society, prepared by Rev. Isaac Ferris, D. D., LL.D. (New York,
   1867), it is stated (p. 25) that the American Bible Society's Version
   Committee in 1847 undertook a ""most careful revision of our English
   text in order to secure its conformity to the British, so as to make
   what should be a standard edition.'' Their final report was made in
   1851. But inasmuch as their changes were many and important, there was
   a constitutional objection to the Society's adopting this revision, and
   then, moreover, there was a deep prejudice or reluctance to any
   alteration; and therefore the revision was rejected in 1852. A new
   committee was appointed, and the Bible, as it came from their hands,
   with some fruits of the labors of the previous committee, is now (since
   1860) the standard of the American Bible Society.

VI . The Anglo-American Revision of the Authorized Version.

   The reasons for desiring a revision may be thus stated: (1.) During the
   268 years since our version was finished the English language has
   undergone some changes; some words have become obsolete, and others
   have changed their signification. In this way sentences which conveyed
   a clear and correct meaning to our ancestors mislead or mystify us. It
   will be sufficient to instance such examples as: to ?ear? for to
   plough; to ?prevent? for to go before, to precede; to let for to
   hinder; carriage for baggage. (2.) Immense strides have been made in
   all biblical studies. The geography and archaeology of the Holy Land,
   the Hebrew and Greek languages, both in grammar and dictionary, are far
   better known now than they could be in King James's time. The A. V. is
   very careless and inconsistent in the use of the article, the tenses
   and modes of verbs. (3.) The text of the Bible is now in a very
   satisfactory state -- much nearer the ipsissima verba of the inspired
   writers than that known in 1611. ''The number of the various readings,""
   says Prof. Ezra Abbot, ""which have been collected from more than 500
   manuscripts, more than a dozen ancient versions, and from the
   quotations in the writings of more than a hundred Christian fathers,
   only attests the exuberance of our critical resources, which enable us
   ?note? to settle the true text of the N. T. with a confidence and
   precision which are wholly unattainable in the case of any Greek or
   Latin classical author; [but] in the time of our translators of 1611
   only a small fraction of our present critical helps was available."" We
   are able to appreciate this remark when we remember that the best texts
   rely on manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, while of our
   Greek and Latin classics many (e. g. Schyliis and Sophocles) are
   transcriptions from only one ancient manuscript, and that not earlier
   than the tenth century. The Anglo-American Bible revision movement
   originated in the Convocation of Canterbury, May 6, 1870, by the
   appointment of a committee of eminent biblical scholars and dignitaries
   of the Church of England to undertake the revision in association with
   scholars from other denominations. The English committee was divided
   into two companies, one for each Testament, who held monthly meetings
   in the Jerusalem Chamber and the Chapter Library at the deanery of
   Westminster, London. The American committee was organized in 1871, on
   invitation of the British committee, to co-operate with it. It was
   similarly composed of representative scholars of different
   denominations, and met for several days of each month in the Bible
   House, New York. The two committees embraced about 80 active members
   (exclusive of about 20 more who died or resigned after the work began),
   and were in constant correspondence. They submitted to each other
   portions of their work as it advanced, and issued one and the same
   revision. The variations of the American committee were embodied in an
   appendix. Some American editions embody these variations in the text.
   The object set before them was to bring King James's version up to the
   present state of the English language without changing the idiom and
   vocabulary, and to the present standard of biblical scholarship. It was
   not the intention to furnish a new version, but merely a conservative
   revision of the received version, so deservedly esteemed in all
   churches. And so slight are most of the changes that the mass of
   readers and hearers will scarcely mark them, while a careful comparison
   will reveal improvements in every chapter and almost every verse. The
   object was to remove acknowledged errors, obscurities, and
   inconsistencies, to make a good and faithful version better and more
   faithful, and thus to bring the old Bible nearer the understanding and
   make it dearer to the heart of English-speaking Christendom. The
   general principles followed by both committees are as follows:

   ""(1.) To introduce as few alterations as possible in the text of the A.
   V. consistently with faithfulness.

   ""(2.) To limit, as far as possible, the expression of such alterations
   to the language of the Authorized and earlier English versions.

   ""(3.) Each company to go twice over the portion to be revised -- once
   provisionally, the second time finally, and on principles of voting as
   hereinafter is provided.

   ""(4.) That the text to be adopted be that for which the evidence is
   decidedly preponderating; and that when the text so adopted differs
   from that from which the A. V. was made, the alteration be indicated in
   the margin.

   ""(5.) To make or retain no change in the text on the second final
   revision by each company except two-thirds of those present approve of
   the same, but on the first revision to decide by simple majorities.

   ""(6.) In every case of proposed alteration that may have given rise to
   discussion, to defer the voting thereupon till the next meeting
   whensoever the same shall be required by one-third of those present at
   the meeting, such intended vote to be announced in the notice for the
   next meeting.

   ""(7.) To revise the headings of chapters, pages, paragraphs, italics,
   and punctuation.

   ""(8.) To refer, on the part of each company, when considered desirable,
   to divines, scholars, and literary men, whether at home or abroad, for
   their opinions.""

   The revised New Testament appeared in England May 17, and in America
   May 20, 1881. Several million copies were sold in a few months. In the
   United States there were, almost at once, upwards of twenty reprints.
   The New Testament for the first time in history supplanted the
   newspaper in popular interest. It was sold upon news-stands, hawked
   through the streets, and read on all public conveyances. It was the
   literary event of the century. Its reception by the religious public
   was most flattering. The revised Old Testament is expected in 1885. It
   will then be for the churches to decide, through their ecclesiastical
   authorities, whether the Anglo-American revision shall supersede King
   James's Version. If the verdict be favorable, the British and Foreign
   and the American Bible Societies can amend their constitutions so as to
   allow them to publish the revised version.

VII. Other Versions, and the Distribution of the Bible.

   The Bible is now printed in 226 different languages or dialects. More
   than four-fifths of these versions are the product of missionary
   scholarship and zeal. In many cases the very language needed to be
   reduced to a written form and permeated with Christian thought before a
   translation could be made. The chief agencies in giving the Scriptures
   this world-wide distribution are: (1.) The British and Foreign Bible
   Society, founded March 7, 1804. Its predecessors, the most prominent of

   general, the ravenous kinds feeding on flesh are forbidden. From Job
   6:6; Luke 11:12 we learn that the eggs of birds were also eaten. In the
   cleansing of the leper birds were used in a peculiar way. Lev 14:4-7.
   There was a humane law in the Jewish code which forbade the taking a
   mother-bird, though her young might be taken. The common mode of taking
   birds was with a snare. Ps 124:7; Prov 7:23; Am 3:5. A speckled bird,
   Jer 12:9, probably means a vulture (in Hebrew), which, as is well
   known, other birds are accustomed to pursue and attack. Some authors
   find etymological reasons for reading ""hyena"" instead of ""speckled
   birds"" in Jer 12:9. Many of the birds of Palestine are similar to our
   own, but, strictly speaking, there is but one species common to both

   celebrated with great pomp. They were looked upon as holy, no business
   was done upon them, and all classes indulged in the festivities
   suitable to the occasion. Every Egyptian attached much importance to
   the day, even to the hour, of his birth."" But the Jews, probably on
   this very account, ""regarded their observance as an idolatrous custom.""
   ""The day of our king,"" spoken of in Hos 7:5, was probably his birthday.
   It was upon Herod's birthday that John Baptist was beheaded. Matt

   son; so was Jehoahaz, 2 Kgs 23:31, Eze 23:36,- and so was Abijah. 2 Chr
   11:18-22. The eldest son seems to have been regarded, in the father's
   absence, as in some respects his representative.

   The paternal blessing was also in a peculiar sense the right of the
   first-born, though the right itself and all the blessings of it might
   be forfeited or transferred, as in the case of Jacob and Esau, Gen
   25:33, Reuben and Joseph. 1 Chr 5:1. But whoever enjoyed it was
   regarded as invested with great dignity and superiority. The Jews
   attached a sacred import to the title ""first born.""

   revile, speak evil, etc.; but in the restricted sense of the Scriptures
   and of common use, it denotes reproachful, irreverent, or insulting
   language concerning God or any of his names or attributes. Lev
   24:10-16. Whoever thinks of the character of God as infinitely holy,
   just, and good will not be surprised that this offence was regarded as
   very heinous, and was punished by stoning. There is no reason to
   suppose that the sin of profane swearing, so common at this day, is
   less odious and offensive to God than it was in the time of Moses.

   Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, Matt 12:32, such as the Pharisees
   were guilty of or were in danger of committing, when they ascribed the
   miracle of curing the blind and dumb man (who was also possessed with a
   demon) to the agency of Beelzebub or Satan, is declared to be
   unpardonable.

   It is far worse than ''grieving the Spirit."" Some persons are
   apprehensive that they have committed this sin and give themselves up
   to despair, but such fears prove that they are still open to recovery
   and pardon. The sin against the Holy Ghost implies a state of final and
   hopeless impenitence, and is committed by those who have again and

   may generally be determined by the connection. Men are said to bless
   God when they ascribe to him the praise and glory which are due to him.
   Ps 134:1-3. God blesses men in bestowing upon them continually mercies,
   spiritual and temporal. Job 42:12; Ps 45:2. And men are said to bless
   their fellow-creatures when, as in ancient times, in the spirit of
   prophecy they predicted blessings to come upon them. This was the kind
   of blessing which the patriarchs pronounced. Gen 49:1-33. So Moses
   blessed Israel. Deut 33:1-29. The form of blessing prescribed by the
   Jewish ritual, Num 6:23-27, is admirably simple and sublime. It was
   pronounced standing, with a loud voice, and with the hands raised
   toward heaven. Luke 24:50. National blessings and cursings were
   sometimes pronounced. Deut 27:1-28:68; Isa 19:25.

   The Cup of Blessing, 1 Cor 10:10, and Cup of Salvation, Ps 116:13, are
   expressions derived from a custom prevalent among the Jews at their
   feasts. The master of the feast took a cup of wine in his hand, and
   solemnly blessed God for it and for all the mercies which were then
   acknowledged. It was then passed to all the guests, each of whom drank
   of it in his turn. The aptness and force of the figures employed in the
   above passages are thus made obvious.","",1

763,Blindness,"BLIND'NESS is extremely common in the East, as all travellers in those
   lands observe. In Egypt especially ophthalmia prevails extensively
   among children and adults. The infliction of blindness was in old times
   a common as well as barbarous punishment or penalty of resistance to a
   victorious enemy. Jud 16:21; 1 Sam 11:2; 2 Kgs 25:7. There are several
   recorded occasions, when, as translated in A. V., God miraculously sent
   blindness. Gen 19:11; 2 Kgs 6:18; Acts 9:8; Acts 13:11. In these
   incidents there was not so much an actual, though transient, loss of
   vision as a confusion of sight -- perhaps really a mental confusion,
   which gave all the uncertainty of actual blindness, as in Luke 24:16.
   The word ''blindness"" is likewise employed in a spiritual sense as
   meaning the sinner's inability to recognize divine truth; e.g. Rom
   11:25; Eph 4:18.","",1
764,Blood,"BLOOD is the fluid of life in the animal body. Ex 29:12. Its use was
   expressly prohibited to Noah when everything else was freely given him.
   Gen 9:4. By the Jewish law also it was expressly and solemnly
   forbidden. Lev 17:10, etc. The reason of this interdiction is probably
   because blood was sacredly appropriated. Lev 17:11. The Jewish ritual
   abounds with the use of blood, Heb 9:22; and the manner of employing it
   is stated with minuteness in Heb 9:1-10:39, where also its use and
   effects are shown in striking contrast with the blood shed upon the
   cross. See also Acts 20:28; Rom 5:9; Eph 1:7; Col 1:14; Heb 7:27; 1
   John 1:7.

   The prohibition of eating blood or animals that are strangled has been
   always rigidly observed by the Jews. In the Christian Church the custom
   of refraining from things strangled and from blood continued for a long
   time. In the council of the apostles held at Jerusalem, Acts 15, it was
   declared that converts from paganism should not be subject to the legal
   ceremonies, but that they should refrain from idolatry, from
   fornication, from eating blood, and from such animals as were strangled
   and their blood thereby retained in their bodies: which precept was
   observed for many ages by the Church. Acts 15:20-29.

   The notion that the blood of the victims was peculiarly sacred to the
   gods is impressed on all ancient pagan mythology. See Christ.

   their present convenient form. Letters were engraved on stone, brick,
   metal (as lead and copper), or wood, and written on cloth and skins,
   and at a later period on parchment. Ex 17:14; 2 Tim 4:13. Tablets of
   lead and brass or copper of great antiquity have been discovered in
   modern times.

   The earliest mode of preserving inscriptions was by engraving on a
   rock. Comp. Job 19:24. The Sinaitic peninsula, especially the Wady
   Mukattab (the ""Sculptured Valley""), and the neighborhood of Mount
   Serbal and Mount Sinai, are full of rock-inscriptions (called the
   Sinaitic Inscriptions).

   The writing-table mentioned Luke 1:63 was probably a tablet covered
   with wax or otherwise prepared to be written upon. Deut 27:2-3. Such
   tablets were used in England as late as the year 1300.

   Leaves and the bark of trees were also used, and were often prepared
   with much skill. The people of Ceylon write with a bodkin on broad and
   thick leaves cut into narrow slips; and these leaves, being fastened
   together, make books which they call alias. The missionaries often
   prepared tracts in this form before paper and printing were introduced
   upon the island. In Sumatra and among the Indians of North America bark
   is still used for making letters and pictures. Leather and linen or
   cotton cloth were also used. These were prepared in the form of long
   rolls, 12 or 14 inches wide, and fastened at each end to sticks (like
   the rollers to which maps are attached), and which were rolled together
   till they met midway. Sometimes these leaves were connected in the form
   of modern books, and opened in the same way. In this case the sheets
   were fastened to rods, and these rods passed through rings, and thus
   formed the back of the book.

   The writing was generally in capital letters and without punctuation or
   division of words; and when used, the reader unrolled the manuscript as
   far as the place which he wished to find, and kept before him just so
   much as he would read.

   The pages resembled the following in their general appearance, though
   they were of course wider and longer than these, and were read from
   right to left:

   These columns could be divided from one another and used separately, as
   we may cut the columns of a newspaper which is printed on one side
   only, and arrange the extracts as we like. Sometimes the reading was
   what is called furrow-wise. The first line was from right to left, and
   the second from left to right, and so on alternately, like ploughing a
   field. The roll or book of curses which Ezekiel saw was 30 feet long
   and 20 wide. The writing was usually on one side, but not always. Eze
   2:10.

   When the roll was done with, it was carefully deposited in a case. The
   cut on the next page shows the book of the Law rolled upon two
   cylinders, with the seal at one side. There were other forms of the
   scroll, and also collections of sheets in the shape of a modern book,
   secured with rings and rods.

   A very good idea may be formed of an ancient roll by supposing a common
   newspaper to have rods or rollers at the right and left sides. The
   reader takes hold of the rods and unrolls the sheet until he comes to
   the desired column. Thus, in Luke 4:17 the phrase ""opened the book""
   would properly read ""unrolled the scroll,"" and in v.Ruth 4:20 for
   ""closed the book"" read ""rolled up the volume"" or ""scroll."" This shows
   the force of the figure, Isa 34:4, where the heavens are represented as
   rolled together as suddenly as the opposite ends of an unrolled scroll
   fly to meet each other when the hand of the reader is withdrawn from
   it.

   A kind of paper was made from the stalk of an Egyptian vegetable called
   papyrus, or paper-reed, which is still found in various parts of India.
   See Bulrush. The stalk was slit with a needle into plates or layers as
   broad and thin as possible. Some of them were 10 or 15 inches broad.
   These strips were laid side by side upon a flat horizontal surface, and
   then immersed in the water of the Nile, which not only served as a kind
   of sizing, but also caused the edges of the strips to adhere together
   as if glued. The sheets thus formed were dried in the sun and then
   covered with a fine wash, which made them smooth and flexible. They
   were finally beaten with hammers and polished. Twenty or more of these
   sheets were sometimes connected in one roll. The pen or [1] style was
   made of some hard substance, perhaps not unlike the instruments used by
   glaziers to cut glass. Jer 17:1. Upon tablets of wax an instrument was
   used, one end of which was pointed, to mark the letters, and the other
   broad and flat, to make erasures. Pens or styles of copper are now used
   by the Ceylonese. On a soft substance like linen or papyrus, the marks
   were painted with a fine hairpencil, as is practised among the Chinese
   to this day.

   Most of the Eastern nations now use the reed-pen, which is split with
   an instrument used as we use the penknife. Jer 36:23. The pith is
   removed, and the bark or rind, being split like a quill, retains and
   properly sheds the ink. It is not hard or stiff enough to be used long
   without mending. See Pen.

   Ink was prepared from a variety of substances (see Ink), and those who
   were skilful in writing wore an inkhorn fastened to the girdle, Eze
   9:2, which is the present mode among the Persians and the Moors of
   Barbary. See Inkhorn. As tables were unknown, the paper or other

   other grains were sometimes used. Jud 7:13.

   The materials were prepared as in modern days. See Mill, Sieve. The
   kneading of the dough was performed in kneading-troughs. Gen 18:6; Ex.
   12:34; Jer 7:18, or wooden bowls such as the Arabians use at this day
   for a like purpose, although some suppose that the kneading was done
   upon a circular piece of leather such as is now used in Persia, and
   which would be more properly called a kneading-bag, as it draws up like
   a knapsack. Either of the utensils would be easily transported. Very
   simple leaven was used in the dough. The loaves were shaped like a
   plate, and when leavened were ordinarily of the thickness of one's
   little finger. See Table. These cakes were generally baked in either
   public or private ovens. The fuel was wood or dried flower-stalks or
   grass. Other modes of baking were, however, used; as by spreading the
   dough upon heated stones or throwing it into the embers of the fire. A
   pan likewise seems to have been used at other times. 2 Sam 13:9. The
   unleavened bread was very thin, and was broken, not cut. Lam 4:4

   food or provisions in general. Bread-corn, Isa 28:28, is used for
   wheat, barley, or any other grain from which bread was made. The
   figurative expressions bread of sorrows, Ps 127:2, and bread of tears,
   Ps 80:5, may denote that the suffering of sorrow and the shedding of
   tears had become as much a part of the portion of every day as one's
   daily bread. So the bread of wickedness, Prov 4:17, and bread of
   deceit, Prov 20:17, denote not only a living or estate obtained by
   fraud and sin, but that to do wickedly is as much the portion of a
   wicked man's life as to eat his daily bread.","",1

   square and made double, with a front and lining, so as to answer for a
   pouch or bag. It was adorned with twelve precious stones. See High
   Priest.

   The two upper corners were fastened to the ephod, from which it was not
   to be loosed, Ex 28:28, and the two lower corners to the girdle. The
   rings, chains, and other fastenings were of gold or rich lace. It was
   called the memorial, Ex 28:12, 1 Chr 2:29, inasmuch as it reminded the
   priest of his representative character in relation to the twelve
   tribes; and it is also called the breastplate of judgment, Ex 28:15,
   perhaps because it was worn by him who was instrumentally the fountain
   of justice and judgment to the Jewish Church. Others think it is
   because the Urim and Thummim were annexed to it. See Urim and Thummim.
   2. The breastplate was also that article of ancient armor which

   if we suppose only natural agencies were employed. Like many other
   travellers, the writer has pieces of pure sulphur and of asphalt or
   mineral pitch, both found in that vicinity in abundance and highly
   inflammable. Volcanic action might easily have filled the air with
   inflammable substances, falling down in streams of liquid fire upon
   those devoted cities.

   expresses terrible punishment.","",1
812,Brother,"BROTHER, BRETH'REN, a term which properly denotes the nearest
   consanguinity -- that is, male children of the same parents, as in Gen
   4:2 and Gen 42:13, but sometimes persons of more remote kindred or of
   the same nation, Gen 13:8; Esth 10:3; Acts 7:25, 2 Kgs 18:37 and Acts
   13:26, or even those who are closely united in affection. 2 Sam 1:26.
   In the N. T. the term is more frequently applied to the spiritual
   relationship which the true followers of Christ sustain to him and to
   each other. Matt 12:50; Rom 14:10; 2 Thess 2:13.

   ""The Brethren of the Lord."" -- The N. T. repeatedly speaks of brethren
   (and also of sisters) of Jesus, and names four of them -- James,
   Joseph, Simon, and Judas. There are three theories about the degree of
   this relationship. 1. The simplest explanation is that they were the
   full brothers of Jesus, or younger children of Joseph and Mary. This is
   the natural deduction from the context. Matt 1:25; Matt 13:55. But the
   feeling of reverence for the virgin mother, the value placed upon
   celibacy in the early Church, the instinctive shrinking from regarding
   Mary as an ordinary woman, bearing children in sorrow, and that, too,
   after the Holy Ghost had overshadowed her and she had given birth to
   the Messiah, -- have suggested to the Roman and Greek Churches and to
   many Protestants two other theories. 2. That they were the children of
   Joseph by a former marriage. So taught Epiphanius and the ancient Greek
   Church. 3. That they were the children of Mary, the wife of Alpheus,
   the supposed sister of the Virgin Mary, and hence that they were
   Christ's cousins, and among the apostles. So St. Jerome and the Roman
   Church. Lange has modified this view by supposing that Alpheus was the
   brother of Joseph, and that because he died early they were adopted by
   Joseph into his family, which is extremely improbable. The strongest
   objection to 1 is that Jesus commended his mother to John. John 19:26.
   2 is not open to any grave objection. 3 is beset with difficulties:
   (1.) It does violence to the natural and usual meaning of the word
   ""brother,"" while the N. T. has a special term for ""cousins."" Col 4:10;
   Luke 1:36. (2.) It assumes that two sisters had the same name, Mary.
   (3.) It fails to explain how these brethren could also be apostles,
   while we are told that they did not believe in Jesus before the
   resurrection and treated him rather disrespectfully. John 7:5. (4.) It
   is probable that Salome, and not Mary, was the sister of our Lord's
   mother. John 19:25. The natural view furnishes an argument in favor of
   the historical character of the Gospels.","",1

   horns, often more than 3 feet in length, which gracefully curve over

824,Burial,"BURIAL, BURY . Gen 23:4; Matt 26:12. It was customary among the Jews,
   and ancients generally, for the children or near kindred to close the
   eyes of the dying. Gen 46:4. A loud and general wailing followed the
   decease, John 11:19, 1 Chr 24:31, 1 Sam 15:33, and continued many days
   after burial. The body of the deceased was washed and laid out. Acts
   9:37. It was wrapped in folds of linen cloth, and the head bound around
   with a napkin. It is said that Lazarus was bound ""hand and foot with
   grave clothes,"" John 11:44, and it is supposed by many that each limb
   had its separate wrapper, as it was customary in Egypt to wrap even
   each finger in a separate cloth or band, so that hundreds of yards of
   cloth are often unwound from one of their mummies. When thus bound
   around, it was placed on a bier, in readiness to be borne to the grave.
   See Bier, Embalm.

   The climate, and the uncleanness which was contracted, under the law,
   from contact with a dead body, or even by coming into the same
   apartment with it, would naturally lead to the custom of early
   interments. In Persia, we are told, it is not customary to keep the
   dead over two or three hours, and the European Jews universally bury
   their dead early. There were many exceptions in this respect, however.
   The practice of embalming was not general among the Jews, though
   spices, etc., were used in their burials. 2 Chr 16:14; John 19:40.
   Jacob and Joseph, whose bodies were embalmed, both died in Egypt, where
   the art of embalming was very skilfully practised. In Jacob's case we
   are told that Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm

   his father, and then he was placed in a coffin in Egypt, and thence his
   body was carried to Machpelah, in Canaan, and buried. Gen 50:2, 1 Kgs
   15:7, Jud 4:12. Coffins were used in Egypt and Babylon, but are unknown
   in the East even at the present day except when a body is to be
   conveyed to a distant place. See Embalm.

   All civilized nations have agreed in attending with some solemnity to
   the burial of their dead. Among the Jews the bier was followed to the
   grave by the nearest relations and other friends. 2 Sam 3:31; Luke
   7:12. Other persons attended, and sometimes mourners (or rather wailers
   by profession) were employed to attend the body. Jer 9:17; Eze 24:17;
   Am 5:16; Matt 9:23. This is the custom now in many Eastern nations.

   Certain places were appropriated by the Jews to the purpose of burying
   the dead, and they were both public and private. Gen 23:4; Gen 50:13;
   Jud 8:32; Jud 16:31; 2 Sam 2:32; 2 Sam 21:14; 2 Kgs 23:6; Jer 26:23.
   They were usually selected in gardens, 2 Kgs 21:18, Acts 11:26; John
   19:41; or fields. Gen 23:11; or caves in the sides of the mountains, 2
   Kgs 23:16-17; or in rocks, Isa 22:16; and to be unburied was regarded
   as exceedingly disgraceful. 1 Sam 17:44-46; 2 Kgs 9:10; Ps 141:7; Jer
   8:2 and Gen 22:19. The grave was called the house or home of the dead.
   Job 30:23; Eccl 12:5. The burial places were usually in retired
   situations, and hence were the resort of demoniacs. Matt 8:28, and were
   usually without the city walls. Kings and prophets alone, it would
   seem, were buried within the walls. Josh 24:30, 1 Sam 15:33; 1 Sam

   prospect, etc. Gen 23:17; Gen 35:8; 1 Sam 31:13.

   The desire to be buried with one's kindred was very strong, 2 Sam
   19:37; and it is remarkable that the Jews, as a people, in all their
   dispersions and sufferings, retain an ardent desire to be buried in
   their own land, especially around Jerusalem.

   It was not unusual for a single family to have near their
   dwelling-house a small building without door or window, built of stone
   or other durable material, which was called the sepulchral house or
   family mansion for the dead. The following description of the tombs of
   the Judges is taken from Baedeker's Palestine and Syria, p. 238: On the
   western side of the rock there is a small fore-court, leading to a
   vestibule, from which is entered the tomb-chamber. The portal was once
   capable of being closed from within. On the left side of the chamber
   are 7 shaft-tombs, above which, at irregular distances, are 3 vaulted
   niche-tombs, and at the back of these again there are several
   shaft-tombs. In the western wall is a niche. Adjoining this first
   chamber on the east and south are 2 others, on about the same level,
   and 2 on a lower level. They have tombs on three sides. A passage with
   3 tombs descends from the first to the north-eastern chamber, which
   contains 13 tombs. The other side-chamber contains no tomb.

   The sepulchres of the Jews were sometimes expensively built and adorned
   or garnished, and were whitened at short intervals, so as to make them
   conspicuous, that they might be avoided, as contact with them
   occasioned ceremonial uncleanness. Hence the

   Plan of Tombs of the Judges. (After de Sauley.)

   famous sepulchres in Palestine are the Machpelah, the burial-place of

830,Butter,"BUT'TER . As this word is used in the Scriptures, it probably means
   sour or coagulated milk, which, when mingled with water, is still
   regarded as a very agreeable and refreshing beverage by Eastern
   nations. Gen 18:8. Their butter, such as it was, might have been
   sometimes clarified and preserved in jars, as at the present day in
   Asia, and when poured out resembles rich oil.

   The figurative expression in Job 29:6, ""I washed my steps with butter,""
   denotes primarily the abundance with which the patriarch was blessed;
   but it is also supposed by some to refer to the great quantities of
   cream which his herds produced, and which were trodden into butter.
   This fanciful interpretation aside, the passage seems to be
   self-explanatory, the figurative allusion to butter having the same
   force and effect as that to oil.

   The place of butter as a general article of food in the East was
   supplied in some measure by the vegetable oil which was so abundant.

   Butter was made by pouring the milk into a goat-skin, and then shaking
   or treading it to and fro in a uniform direction until the separation
   of the butter took place. The butter mentioned in Jud 5:25 was probably
   cream, or a preparation of which cream was a component part. It is not
   improbable that the bottle of milk in the passage cited was no other
   than a skin which had been used as a churn, and that the refreshment
   was butter-milk, presented in the richest vessel that was at hand.
   Butter-milk is still esteemed a most refreshing beverage by the Arabs.
   Butter and honey were used together, and were esteemed among the
   choicest productions of the land. And travellers tell us that the Arabs

   23:33; was in bonds there two years, Acts 24:27; it was the official

   It had a learned school and an episcopal see; was the birthplace of
   Procopius; the residence for a time of Origen; of Eusebius, the
   historian, who was bishop of Caesarea; was a noted city in the time of
   the Crusades; was twice rebuilt by the Christians; fell into decay; and
   is now in ruins. It is called Knisnrieh. Large quantities of the

   is a town at the base of Mount Hermon, about 20 miles north of the Sea
   of Galilee and 45 miles south-west of Damascus. It was the northern
   limit of our Lord's journeys. Matt 16:13; Mark 8:27, and was probably
   Baal-gad of Old Testament history. It was here that Peter, in the name
   of all the other apostles, made that fundamental confession of faith in
   Christ as the Son of God and the Saviour, and that Christ uttered the
   prophecy concerning the indestructible character of his Church. Matt
   16:16 ff. The gushing waters of the sources of the Jordan and the
   immovable rocks of Mount Hermon were in full view when our Lord spoke
   those words, and served to illustrate their meaning. The landscape is
   one of the most beautiful in Palestine, and has been called the Syrian
   Tivoli.

   History. -- The town is remarkable for its physical and historical
   associations. It was near two important sources of the Jordan; its
   ancient classical name was Paneion, in commemoration of the sanctuary
   of the god Pan; it was enlarged by Philip the Tetrarch, and named
   Caesarea-Philippi to distinguish it from the other Caesarea, on the
   Mediterranean; later on it was called Neronias by Herod Agrippa II.; it
   became the seat of a bishopric; it was repeatedly

   equally the highest functionaries and the lowest menials.""","",1
845,Caiaphas,"CA'IAPHAS (depression) was the high priest of the Jews, a.d. 27-36, and
   therefore at the time of our Saviour's trial. John 11:49, Jer 25:51.
   The office was formerly held for life, but at this time it was filled
   and vacated at the pleasure of the Roman government. The raising of
   Lazarus roused the Sanhedrin to action, and Caiaphas turned their
   thoughts toward the execution of the hated and feared Prophet by
   deliberately advising his death on the score of expediency. His
   language was unconsciously prophetic. John 11:49-52.

   After Christ's arrest he was arraigned before Caiaphas. A vain effort
   having been made to secure false testimony sufficient for his
   condemnation, Caiaphas at last adjured him to declare whether he was
   indeed the Christ, the Son of God. On Jesus's answering affirmatively,
   Caiaphas pretended to be so shocked at his supposed blasphemy that he
   declared all further witness was unnecessary to convict him, and the
   council unanimously condemned him to death. Matt 26:65-68.

   As Caiaphas had no power to inflict the punishment of death, Christ was
   taken from him to Pilate, the Roman governor, John 18:28, that his
   execution might be duly ordered. See Annas. Before Caiaphas, Peter and
   John were brought for trial. Acts 4:6.","",1

   sacrifice had been accepted and his own rejected, he slew his brother.
   See Abel.

   For this crime he was banished from his home. But God, remembering
   mercy in the midst of wrath, gave him some sign or mark whereby he
   would have protection from attacks likely to be made upon him as the
   accursed of God. He then went to the land of Nod, to the east of Eden;
   after the birth of his son Enoch (and perhaps other children), he began
   to build a city -- i. e. a village of rude huts, as distinguished from
   the movable tents of the nomads. Gen 4:16-17. See Nod.

   in circuit. The Rawlinsons, Geo. Smith, and others, place it at

    1. One of the twelve spies sent by Moses into Canaan. Num 13:6. He and
       Joshua were the only adults born in Egypt who entered the land as
       conquerors, because they brought a truthful report, while the other
       ten were frightened, told exaggerated stories of the native
       population, and spread discontent and despair. Caleb and Joshua
       assured the people that they might easily gain possession of
       Canaan. In return for these assurances, the people proposed to
       stone them. A plague from the Lord broke out, and the lying spies
       were all killed. Num 13:1-14:45. Forty-five years afterward, when
       the conquest was completed and the land apportioned among the
       tribes, Caleb, being then eighty-five years of age, applied to
       Joshua for his share, reminding him of the promise of God, by which
       he and Joshua were excepted from the general curse of the people,
       and proposed to take, as his share of the land, Kirjath-arha, the
       stronghold of the giants and the centre of their fortifications.
       His request was granted, and he accordingly attacked and subdued
       Kirjath-arha, and thence proceeded to Kirjath-sepher, another
       stronghold, afterward called Debir. Here he proposed to give his
       daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who should capture the city.
       His nephew, Othniel, undertook the enterprise and succeeded, and
       received the promised reward. Caleb's possessions were called by
       his name. Josh 14:1-15:63; 1 Sam 30:14.

       identical with the spy.","",1

   assigned to Caleb. 1 Sam 30:14.","",1
855,Calf,"CALF. Gen 18:7. A fatted calf was regarded by the Jews as the choicest
   animal food. 1 Sam 28:24; Am 6:4; Luke 15:23. The allusion in Jer 34:18
   is to an ancient custom of ratifying a contract or covenant in the
   observance of which an animal was slain and divided, and the parties
   passed between the parts, signifying their willingness to be so divided
   themselves if they failed to perform their covenant. Gen 15:9-10, 2 Sam
   21:17. Calf, Molten, Ex 32:4, was an idol god prepared by Aaron in
   compliance with the request of the children of Israel, who had become
   impatient at the absence of Moses and desired some visible image or
   representation of the Deity. See Aaron. It was probably made of wood
   and thickly overlaid with gold.

   The golden calves of Jeroboam, 1 Kgs 12:28, were objects of worship set
   up by that king in the land of Israel to prevent the ten tribes from
   resorting to Jerusalem to worship, and so more effectually

   idolatrous worship while he dwelt in Egypt. 1 Kgs 11:40. His sin is
   almost always mentioned whenever his name is used. See Jeroboam.

   Calves of our Lips, Hos 14:2, is a figurative expression signifying the
   fruits of our lips, or our offerings of praise to God. Calves were used
   in sacrifices, and we are to render praises and thanksgivings to God as
   the offering of our lips. Heb 13:15.","",1
856,Calneh,"CAL'NEH (fortified place?), a city of Chaldaea founded by Nimrod. Gen
   10:10; Am 6:2; probably the same as Calno, Isa 10:9, and Canneh, Eze
   27:23. Some have proposed to locate Calneh at Ctesiphon, or
   Kileh-Shenjhat, on the Tigris, 40 miles below Nimroud. Rawlinson and
   others, however, place ancient Asshur at Kileh-Sherghat, and identify
   Calneh with Niffer. The ruins at Niffer are 60 miles north-west of
   Warka, and on the east side of the Euphrates, but 30 miles from the
   present course of the river. They are conceded to be of very great
   antiquity, and are divided into nearly equal groups by a deep ravine or
   channel, 120 feet wide, apparently the dry bed of a river which once
   ran through the town. Inscriptions found in the mounds indicate that
   the ancient name of the city was Nijnir, probably the Nojiher of the
   Talmud, and hence the Calneh of Genesis.","",1
857,Calvary,"CAL'VARY (skull), the place where our Lord was crucified, so called
   from its conical shape. There is no Scripture warrant for the popular
   phrase ""Mount Calvary."" It was simply an elevation. Tradition places
   the site at the modern church of the Holy Sepulchre, within the present
   walls of Jerusalem. This view is stoutly maintained by George Williams,
   Ritter, Krafft, Raumer, Rosen, De Saulcy, Sepp, Tischendorf, and
   several of the members of the British Palestine Survey. It is as
   stoutly disputed by Robinson, Tobler, John Wilson, Barclay, Thomson,
   Bonar, Meyer, Ewald, S. J. Andrews, and others.

   The arguments turn chiefly on the course of the second wall of Josephus
   -- whether it ran so as to include or to exclude the present church of
   the Holy Sepulchre. The evangelists place Calvary distinctly outside of
   the city in Matt 28:32; Heb 13:12;John 19:20, 1 Chr 4:41. The church of
   the Holy Sepulchre is inside the present city, which is much smaller
   now than in the time of Christ. To establish the traditional site it
   must be proved that the second wall excluded the church, which is quite
   improbable. Mr. Schick and Bishop Gobat of Jerusalem locate Calvary
   near the Grotto of Jeremiah, north-west of the Damascus gate; Fisher
   Howe and Conder, on the Grotto of Jeremiah; Barclay suggests a place
   near Gethsemane. As in the case of Moses, so in that of Jesus, it may
   be best that the exact place of his crucifixion and burial remain
   unknown and out of the reach of profanation and idolatry.","",1
858,Camel,"CAM'EL, a well-known and highly useful animal in Eastern countries, and
   justly called ""the ship of the desert."" It is by the law of Moses
   unclean. Lev 11:4. The camel is usually about 6 feet in height to the
   saddle. Though he makes loud complaints when caused to kneel or receive
   a load, he is still docile, and marches on as under a painful sense of
   duty. He varies in color from white to black, but is ordinarily tawny.
   In the Bible lands the Arabian or one-humped camel ( Camelits
   dromedcuius) is found. Two-humped camels (C. Bactrianus) are rarely
   used except in Central Asia. The feet of this animal are provided with
   a tough, elastic sole, which prevents them from sinking in the sand.
   His hump serves as a cushion for loads, Isa 30:6, and a store-house of
   food against times of scarcity. There is a large callus on his breast
   and three pairs of calluses on his legs, which protect him from
   laceration when kneeling upon sharp stones. His nostrils are adapted
   for breathing with safety in a sandstorm. A horny mouth with divided
   upper lip is fitted for the harsh and thorny shrubs of the desert,
   which he seems to prefer to more tender herbage. The second stomach of
   the camel, which is a ruminant animal, is divided into hexagonal cells,
   and receives and retains for gradual use the water which is drunk. On a
   full supply he can live even 20 or 30 days. As the camel never sensibly
   perspires, there is no loss in this direction. These qualities all
   combine to

   CAM

   CAM

   adapt the animal to the countries he inhabits and to the services
   required of him. He is, perhaps, more sure-footed than the ass, more
   easily supported, and capable of an incomparably greater burden. He can
   carry a load of 600 or 800 pounds

   Camel

   at the rate of 30 miles a day, and, on short journeys, 1000 to 1200
   pounds. His usual speed is two and a half miles an hour, but the breed
   of fast camels called distinctively dromedaries, Jer 2:23, will travel
   100 miles a day.

   Like a docile colt, this animal is driven or led by a rude halter.
   Crescent-shaped ornaments of cloth and cowrie-shells, or even of
   silver, are often hung to the camel's neck Jud 8:21, Acts 11:26. The
   flesh and milk are used for food (except by Jews); the skin and hair
   are employed for garments; the bones are cut into various articles and
   sometimes the dung is needed for fuel.

   The ordinary life of the camel is from 30 to 50 years. Camels were
   formerly, and are still, in the East, among the chief possessions of
   the wealthy. Gen 12:16; Gen 30:43; Gen 37:25; Jud 6:5 and Num 7:12; 1
   Sam 30:17; 1 Kgs 10:2; 1 Chr 5:21;2 Chr 14:15; Job 1:3 and Job 42:12;
   Isa 30:6.

   The expression in Matt 19:24 is usually considered figurative, denoting
   something beyond human power. The same form of expression is used among
   the Arabs and by the Rabbins in respect to the elephant. Some believe
   that the expression refers to the small door within the large and heavy
   door of the Oriental gate, for this is called in Arabic ""the needle's
   eye."" Rolla Floyd (a well-known Syrian dragoman) told the writer that
   till recently it was the custom to close the gates of Jerusalem from 12
   till 2 on Fridays during Mohammedan worship, but this small door might
   then be used. On one such occasion, Mr. F. was waiting outside the
   Jaffa gate for some travellers, when a train of camels arrived. He saw
   them enter the city by unloading each animal and taking it separately
   through ""the needle's eye.""

   Another figurative expression occurs Matt 23:24, in which the
   inconsistency of the scribes and Pharisees (who attended to the most
   unimportant ceremonies of their religion, while they were unjust,
   unmerciful, and faithless) is compared to one who should very carefully
   strain out (not at) a gnat or other small insect from the liquor he was
   about to drink, and yet swallow an animal as large as a camel. See
   Drink.

   Travellers sometimes throw over the camel, upon the top of his burden,
   a pair of panniers, in which they ride, one on either side. Two boxes
   like small carriage-bodies are often hung upon the animal in the same
   manner, and in these females may ride and be sheltered from the heat.
   Gen 24:64. It is easy to see how Rachel might have concealed her
   father's idols. Gen 31:34. The camel is said to choose ruinous and
   desolate places for his habitations, and hence the force of the
   prophetic language respecting Rabbah, Eze 25:5; though the prophecy
   would be abundantly verified if the place should merely become a
   stopping-place for caravans.

   Camel's Hair, Matt 3:4, was made into cloth. 2 Kgs 1:8; Zech 13:4.
   Sometimes the fabric was wrought of the finest and softest part of the
   hair, and was then a very rich and luxurious article of dress. A
   coarser kind was used for the covering of tents and for the upper
   garments of shepherds and camel-drivers. Travellers tell us that modern
   dervishes wear cloth of this kind, and also leathern girdles. The
   raiment of John the Baptist, Matt 11:8, was probably of this kind, for
   it is put in opposition to soft raiment; but some think it was of
   prepared camel's hide.","",1

   passages of the Levitical law relate to things that are to be done
   within or without the camp.

   The form of encamping, Ex 16:13, is particularly prescribed in Num 2.
   The tabernacle occupied the centre, and nearest to this were the tents
   of the Levites, who were intrusted with the principal care of it. Num
   3. The whole body of the people, embracing upward

   of 600,000 fighting-men, besides women and children, were formed in
   four divisions, three tribes constituting a division, so that the
   tabernacle was enclosed in a hollow square. Each of these divisions had
   a standard, as well as each tribe and each of the large family
   associations of which the tribes were composed. Each tribe had its
   captain or commander assigned by God's direction. The view of such a
   mass of people, maintaining the most perfect order and subordination,
   might well excite the admiration of the beholder. Num 24:2-5. It is not
   difficult to imagine the emotions which such a view would awaken in one
   who, from the summit of Mount Peor, looked down upon the vast
   congregation of the Lord's people gathered around the sacred symbols of
   his presence.


   ""How beautiful are thy tents, Jacob!

   And thy tabernacles, O Israel!

   As the Valleys are they spread forth;

   As gardens by the river's side;

   As the_trees_of_lign_aloes which Jehovah hath planted,

   As cedars beside the waters.""

   Num 24:5-6.

   "" Outside of the camp "" must all defilement and all defiled persons be
   put. Consequently, lepers, those defiled by contact with the dead,
   captives taken in war, were kept out for a greater or less period, and
   the ashes of the sacrifice and all that was not burnt on the altar were
   carried out. The dead were there buried, and there executions and the
   burning of the young bullock for the sin-offering took place. See
   references in order:Lev 13:46; Lev 14:3; Num 12:14-15; Num 31:19; Josh

   But the Israelites traversed a country broken up into innumerable
   little valleys, and oftentimes the host must have stretched along for
   miles, but so closely hemmed in between mountain-sides that to go
   without the camp would be but a few steps. In later times, when Israel

   History.n-Previous to its conquest by Joshua, Canaan was peopled by
   several tribes, as Hittites, Jebusites, Amorites, Girgasites, Hivites,
   Perizzites, and four others, all early known as Canaanites. Gen
   10:15-19. Later, ""Canaanites"" appears to designate a separate tribe,
   and the land was inhabited by them and six other tribes. Canaan was the
   country for which Terah started, Gen 11:31; Abram dwelt in it; it was
   promised to him for a possession. Gen 12:5, 1 Kgs 15:8, etc.; Isaac,
   Jacob, and the patriarchs made their home there. Gen 26-35. It was left
   by Jacob because of the famine; searched by the twelve spies. Num 13:2;
   viewed by Moses, Deut 32:49; conquered by Joshua, Josh 11:23; divided
   by lot among the twelve tribes. Josh 13:7; a king of the country was
   slain by Deborah and Barak. Jud 4:24. See Map.

   In the temple at Karnak, in Egypt, a triple list of 118 or 119 towns of
   Canaan has lately been discovered, which is believed to be a record of
   an Egyptian conquest of the land by Thuthmes III, previous to that by
   Joshua. See the list of these towns in Conder's Tent-Work in Palestine,

   the top was about three feet and a half. It was richly adorned with
   raised work representing flowers, and also knops or knobs, and little
   bowls resembling half an almond-shell. At the extremity of each branch
   there was a socket for the lamp and also at the top of the main shaft,
   making seven in all. Tongs to remove the snuff and dishes to receive
   it, as well as oil-vessels, were articles of furniture belonging to the
   candlestick, and were all made of gold. The lights were trimmed and
   supplied daily with the purest olive-oil. They were lighted at night
   and extinguished in the morning, though some suppose that a part of
   them at least were kept burning through the day. The candlestick was so

   collection of books of the O. and N.T. which form the original and
   authoritative written rule of faith and practice in the Christian
   Church.

   I. The O.T. Canon.--Our Bible is a growth of many generations. Moses
   put the ""book of the law"" in the side of the ark. Deut 31:26. This
   book, which contained not alone direct precepts, Ex 24:7, but also
   general exhortations, Deut 28:61, and historical narratives, Ex 17:14,
   was further increased by the records of Joshua, Josh 24:26, and
   probably by other writings. 1 Sam 10:25. At a subsequent time
   collections of psalms and proverbs were made. The later prophets,
   especially Jeremiah, were familiar with the writings of their
   predecessors. But although book was added to book, there probably was
   no collection made containing them all until the Captivity. According
   to Jewish tradition, the formation of the canon of the O. T. in its
   present form was due to Ezra and the men of the ""great synagogue."" The
   division of the O. T. into three parts -- the Law, the Prophets, and
   the Hagiographa -- i. e. the remaining sacred writings -- (see Bible)
   was not arbitrary or accidental, but was a reflection of the true
   historical order of their composition. The Law is the foundation of the
   Jewish state; the Prophets relate the story of the struggles of the
   Jews against internal and external dangers, and likewise the revelation
   of the divine Mind toward them and their neighbors; the Hagiographa
   contain additional information, and, above all, the outpourings of the
   nation's heart and the expression of their wisdom. According to
   Josephus, there were only 22 books in the sacred canon, corresponding
   to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. But this short list
   was made by combining several books which we properly separate. Thus,
   the two books of Samuel, of Kings, of Chronicles, formed but one book
   respectively; Judges and Ruth, Ezra and Nehemiah, Jeremiah and
   Lamentations, were similarly combined; and finally, the twelve minor
   prophets were reckoned as one book. And although other lists, slightly
   different, are given, still the main fact is testified to that the Jews
   had a certain fixed and uniform amount of writing to which they gave a
   divine character and paid peculiar regard. This list does not include
   the Apocrypha of the Septuagint, which, accordingly, has been excluded
   from the Protestant O. T., though often printed between the Testaments.
   The Roman Catholic Church, however, receives them as authentic. The
   British and Foreign Bible Society ceased to print them after 1826. The
   American Bible Society likewise omits them. We may therefore say that
   the O. T., as we have it to-day, existed shortly after the Captivity,
   and that the present number and arrangement of the books do not affect
   its age, since nothing has been added or omitted which had any right to
   be in the canon or the individual books. The canon as we have it
   existed in our Lord's day, as is evident from the quotations in the N.
   T. by him and his disciples. There are in all 275 quotations from
   different books, but, with the exception of the words of Enoch in Jude,
   no book out of the canon is used for this purpose. We may therefore
   feel certain that we have a canon endorsed by the highest conceivable
   authority. It should, however, be borne in mind that the Septuagint
   version is generally quoted, even when it differs from the Hebrew. The
   apostles were no slaves of the letter, but used the Scriptures in the
   freedom of the Spirit.

   II . The N. T. Canon.-- The history of the collection and authoritative
   determination of the N. T. canon may be divided into three periods. 1.
   Down to a.d. 170. -- Paul claimed for his Epistles ''a public use and
   an authoritative power."" 1 Thess 5:27; 2 Thess 3:6; Col 4:16; 1 Tim
   4:6. John solemnly warns against any additions to or deductions from
   the book of Revelation. Rev 22:18-19. Peter significantly puts Paul's
   Epistles side by side with ""the other Scriptures."" 2 Pet 3:16. Nothing
   is more striking than the great difference in contents and expression
   between the N. T. and the Christian writings of the following
   centuries. This difference is a subsidiary but convincing proof of the
   inspiration of the former. We see in the Apostolic Fathers (a.d.
   70-120) evidence of acquaintance with at least the majority of our
   present N. T. The period from a.d. 120-170 has been termed the age of
   the apologists. These efforts to defend the Christian faith led to a
   new use of the facts of Christ's life, and it then became manifest how
   greatly superior the four Gospels were to all other accounts; and
   accordingly, they were separated and assigned to a place of honor and
   absolute authority. At the close of the period was composed the
   Muratorian canon in the West, while about the same time appeared the
   Syriac translation of the N. T. called the Peshito, and the first Latin
   versions called Itala.
    1. From a.d. 170 to A.D. 303.-- As the result of the investigations in
       the patristic writings of this period, Westcott declares that the
       four Gospels, the Acts, 1 Peter, 1 John, 13 Epistles of Paul, and
       the Apocalypse (the Revelation) were accepted by the Church, and,
       with the exception of the Apocalypse, have never been questioned
       since until modern times. Speaking generally, we may say that of
       the so-called ""disputed"" books of the N.T. the Apocalypse was
       universally received by all the Christian writers, while the
       Epistle to the Hebrews found acceptance in the Oriental, but not in
       the Occidental, Church. Judging from the writings, ""the Epistles of
       James and Jude and the second and third of John were little used,
       and the second of Peter was barely known.""
    2. From a.d. 302 to A.D. 307.-- At the close of this period the third
       Council of Carthage, a.d. 397, took place, memorable as that by
       which the present canon of the N.T., with its 27 books, was
       ratified. Since that time it has remained unchanged. Luther revived
       doubts concerning some of the 7 books which Eusebius calls
       ""disputed,"" especially the Epistle of James (which he could not
       harmonize with Paul's doctrine of justification by faith); but
       these were private opinions, and were not adopted by the Lutheran
       Church. All the Protestant Churches agree with the Greek and the
       Roman Churches as regards the extent of the canon of the N. T. And
       this little book contains the chief wisdom of the world, and will
       continue to guide mankind in the way of salvation to the end of
       time.","",1
873,Canticles,CAN'TICLES . See Song of Solomon.,"",1
874,Capernaum,"CAPER'NAUM (town of Nahum), a city of great interest as the home of
   Jesus after he left Nazareth. Though it fills a large place in the
   gospel narrative, it is not once mentioned in O.T. history, nor in any
   portion of the Bible except the four Gospels. It is called Christ's
   ""own city,"" Matt 9:1, and it was the scene of some of his most
   remarkable miracles, labors, and discourses. Matt 8:5-14; 2 Cor 9:2;
   Matt 17:24; John 6:17-59;Deut 4:46, etc. Much exploration, study, and
   discussion have been given to determine its true site, but the question
   is still unsettled.

   The gospel narrative throws some general, though not very definite,
   light upon the location of this lost city. It was (1) a city of
   Galilee, Luke 4:31; (2) by the lake-coast. Matt 4:13; John 6:17, Jud
   6:24; (3) with collectors of customs, and probably a custom-house, Matt
   17:24; Mark 2:1, 2 Kgs 22:14; Luke 5:27 compared with Matt 9:1,Gal 1:9;
   (4) it had a noted synagogue, built by a Roman centurion, Matt 8:5;
   Mark 1:21; Luke 7:1,1 Chr 6:5; (5) it was joined with Chorazin and
   Bethsaida in the woes pronounced upon them by Christ, and its complete
   destruction was predicted. Matt 11:20-23; Luke 10:13-15; (6) it has
   been inferred also from the Scriptures that Capernaum was in the land
   of Gennesaret, but this is not certain. Comp. Matt 14:34 with John
   6:16-17, John 6:24-25. These indicate that the city was on the west
   side of the Sea of Galilee, and near its northern end.

   Two places have been mainly urged as marking the site of ancient
   Capernaum:(1) Khan Minyeh, supported by Robinson (1852), Macgregor
   (1864), Porter (1875), Kiepert, Sepp, and by members of the recent
   British and American Palestine Exploration Societies (Kitchener and
   Merrill); (2) Tell Hum, maintained by Dr. Wilson, Major Wilson, W. M.
   Thomson, Stanley, Hepworth Dixon, Ritter, Baedeker, Delitzsch,
   Plumptre, Schaff, and others.

   Tell Hum is a ruin near the Sea of Galilee, about two miles south-west
   of where the river Jordan enters the sea. Khan Minyeh is a Saracen inn
   on the northern extremity of the plain of Gennesaret (el-Gkuweir),
   about 5 miles south-west of the mouth of the Jordan and 2 1/2 to 3
   miles below Tell Hum, and situated near the lake.

   Several other places have been suggested:as Ain Mudaumrah, once urged,
   but afterward abandoned, by Tristram, and ruins near Bethsaida Julias;
   but their claims are generally regarded as not well supported.

   The argument from tradition is divided between Khan Minyeh, and Tell
   Hum, but prevailingly in favor of Tell Hum. Conder (Tent Work in
   Palestine, ii. 182) claims Jewish and Arab tradition for Khan Minyeh,
   but Dr. Thomson and Furrer claim it decidedly for Tell Hum.

   The arguments for Khan Minyeh, briefly stated, are: (1) It is near the

   Gennesaret, from Khan Minyeh. (From a Photograph taken for the
   Palestine Exploration Fund.)

   sea-shore, while Tell Hum is at some distance from the shore; (2) it is
   in the land of Gennesaret, if Gennesaret is identical with el-Ghuweir;
   (3) it is well located for a custom-house, on the highway from
   Jerusalem to Damascus.

   The arguments in support of Tell Hum mainly are; (1) The extensive
   ruins, covering a space half a mile long by a quarter of a mile wide,
   indicate a large city like Capernaum; (2) the ruins of a large
   synagogue have been discovered there; (3) when Christ crossed the lake
   from Capernaum, Mark 6:33, the crowd ran around the end of the lake to
   meet him; and it is claimed that Tell Hum is more likely, therefore, to
   have been his starting-point than Khan Minyeh; (4:) Josephus, wounded
   on the plain of Batikha, at the north end of the lake, was carried to
   Capernaum, most likely the nearest place -- not, therefore, at Khan
   Minyeh, but Tell Ham; (5) historical narratives of the sixth and
   seventh centuries and the Jewish and Arab tradition appear to favor
   Tell Hum as Capernaum; (6) the identity of name, for Capernaum means ""
   the village"" (Kefe or Kafr) ""of Nahum,"" and Tell Hum means ""the mound
   or ruins of Hum"" -- i. e. Nahum.

   The strongest argument against Khan Minyeh is the absence of ruins of
   sufficient importance to indicate a city of the size of Capernaum. The
   English Survey party in 1866 dug up at Khan Minyeh chiefly fragments of
   pottery; Kitchener in 1877 examined the more extensive excavations,
   bringing to light what appeared to him to be a wall of squared stones.
   Robinson conjectures that the ruins of Capernaum were transported to
   Tiberias,but Tiberias was already built when Capernaum was in its
   prosperity. Those who place Capernaum at Khan Minyeh usually locate
   Chorazin at Tell Hum and Bethsaida at Et-Tabigkah. This theory leaves
   the important ruins at Kerazeh to be explained. As the latter cannot be
   ignored, they form a strong objection to Khan Minyeh. If, however,
   Capernaum was at Tell Hum, then Chorazin was doubtless at Kerazeh, and
   no important ruins remain unexplained.

   At present, therefore, the arguments are strongly in favor of Tell Hum,
   but a final decision of the question must wait further excavations. The
   explorations of the English society organized in 1878-1879 for the
   purpose of determining the sites of the three cities may furnish
   information for the satisfactory settlement of this question.

   Ruins at Tell Hum. -- The most remarkable ruin at Tell Hum is that of a
   Jewish synagogue. Around this, and up the slope behind it, are the
   remains of an ancient town; the walls of many private houses can be
   traced, and the appearance of a main street leading toward ancient
   Chorazin. The synagogue was about 75 feet long by 58 feet wide; its
   walls were built of hard white limestone, almost marble, resting on
   basaltic rock. Portions of columns, pedestals, capitals of the
   Corinthian order, and blocks of stone have been uncovered on its site,
   and on the lintel of a door a representation of the pot of manna was
   discovered, recalling the words of Jesus: ""Your fathers did eat manna
   in the wilderness, and are dead."" John 6:49. If Tell Hum is Capernaum,
   then this synagogue was doubtless the one which

   Ruins at Tell Hum. (From a Photograph. Palestine Exploration Fund.)

   the pious Roman centurion built, Luke 7:1-10, and in which Jesus
   taught.

   North of the town are two tombs, one built under ground of limestone
   blocks after the hard basaltic rock had been cut away; the other above
   ground and whitewashed within and without, as in our Lord's day. Matt
   23:27.

   The road from Khan Minyeh to Tell Hum now leads over the rocks at some
   height above the lake. It is a narrow path, more like an ancient
   conduit than a road. From this height the view extends to Tiberias. A
   short distance from Khan Minyeh by the seashore is Ain et-Tin, or ''Fig
   Spring"" (which Dr. Robinson erroneously identified with the spring
   ""Kapharnaum,"" mentioned by Josephus). A mile farther north is the
   charming bay Et-Tabigkah, by which some locate western Bethsaida, but
   at which, more probably, was the suburb and harbor of Capernaum; here
   is a very copious fountain abounding in fish (probably the ""Kapharnaum
   "" of Josephus), and a large stream which turns a mill and once watered,
   through an aqueduct, the plain of Gennesaret. The road from Et-Tabigkah
   continues northward along the bank, on which several springs and the
   remains of buildings are to be seen, until it reaches Tell Hum. From
   thence northward to Kerazeh, probably Choraziri, is about 2 miles, and
   there are traces of a paved road which connected the city with the
   great caravan-road to Damascus. Following the shore of the lake to the
   north-west about 2 miles, where the Jordan empties into the Sea of
   Galilee, is Abu Zuny, which Dr. Thomson regards as Bethsaida, the
   birthplace of Peter and Andrew. The ruin of all these cities has been
   so complete as to render their very sites doubtful, and strikingly to
   remind us of the fearful prediction of our Lord concerning them. Matt
   11:21-23.","",1
875,Caphtor,"CAPH'TOR (chaplet), the original home of the Caphtorim or Philistines.
   Deut 2:23; Jer 47:4; Am 9:7. Some have placed it in Cappadocia, others
   in Cyprus or in Crete. It is more probably identical with Caphtur, and
   the northern delta of Egypt.","",1
876,Cappadocia,"CAPPADO'CIA, the largest and most easterly province of Asia Minor. On
   the north was Pontus, on the east the Euphrates, beyond which were
   Armenia and Mesopotamia, on the south Syria and Cilicia, and on the
   west Galatia. It was high table-land, intersected by ranges of
   mountains, sparsely wooded, but good for grain or grazing. Cappadocia
   was conquered by Cyrus, ruled by Alexander the Great, tributary to the
   Seleucidae, and became a Roman province, a.d. 17. Some of its people
   were in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, Acts 2:9, and afterward
   Christians of the province were addressed by Peter. 1 Pet 1:1.","",1
877,Captain,"CAP'TAIN, an officer in the Jewish army whose rank or power was
   designated by the number of men under his command, as captain of fifty
   or captain of a thousand, and the commander or chief of the whole army
   was called the captain of the host. Deut 1:15 2 Sam 19:13, etc. The
   divisions of the army were regulated in some measure by the division of
   families, as the heads of families were usually officers. 2 Chr 25:5.
   Captains of hundreds,

   A Roman Captain or Centurion.

   or larger companies, were probably what would be called in modern
   phrase staff-officers, and formed the council of war. 1 Chr 13:1. The
   ''captain of the guard,"" Acts 28:16, was the commander of the
   Praetorian troops at Rome. See Centurion.

   Captain of the Temple, Acts 4:1, was the chief of the priests and
   Levites who kept guard around and within that sacred edifice. In this
   non-military sense is Christ called ''Captain"" in Heb 2:10.","",1
878,Captive,"CAP'TIVE . Gen 14:14. Usually denotes one taken in war. Among Eastern
   nations such persons were treated with great cruelty, and were subjects
   of merchandise. For instances of this merciless treatment see Jud 1:7;1
   Sam 11:2; 2 Sam 8:2; 2 Kgs 26:7. It is a remarkable fact that though
   the Israelites dealt in many instances harshly with those they
   captured, yet their conduct stood out in such favorable contrast to
   that of heathen nations that the humanity of some even of their worst
   kings was reckoned upon by their conquered enemies. 1 Kgs 20:31-34. The
   passage Joel 3:3 brings out into melancholy prominence both the lot of
   prisoners of war and also the contempt manifested for the Jews. The
   Bible (Speaker's) Commentary thus expounds the verse: ""The Jewish
   prisoners were held so cheap that a slave-girl was sold by her captor
   for a draught of wine, and a slave-boy was given in place of the small
   coin thrown to a prostitute. During the Jewish war Titus took 97,000
   prisoners, of whom he publicly sold all that were under 17 years of
   age. After Hadrian's Jewish war four Jews were sold for a measure of
   barley at Hebron."" The Romans sometimes compelled a captive to be
   joined with a dead body, and to bear it about until the horrible
   effluvia destroyed the life of the living. The capture of Judea by the
   Romans, a.d. 70, was commemorated by coins which are shown in the
   following cut:

   Coins to Commemoration the Capture of Judea. (Farrar's ""Life of
   Christ."") On the left-hand coin Is seen the emperor Titus; Judea is
   weeping at the foot of a palm tree. On the right hand, a Jewish captive
   with hands tied behind his back looks upon a Jewess seated at the foot
   of a palm tree.","",1
879,Captivity,"CAPTIV'ITY. Num 21:29. A term usually employed to denote an important
   era in the history of the Jewish people. To punish their rebellions and
   idolatries, God suffered them to come into frequent bondage to
   surrounding nations. Six of their partial and transient captivities
   took place at an early period of their history, of which a particular
   account is given in Judges. Soon after the close of Solomon's reign the
   kingdom was divided. Ten of the tribes took the name of ""the kingdom of
   Israel,"" leaving the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to constitute the
   kingdom of Judah. Each of these two kingdoms suffered a distinct
   captivity. The Jews reckon four national captivities nthe Babylonian,
   the Median, the Grecian, and the Roman.

   Pul, b.c. 762, and then Tiglath-pileser, b.c. 740, kings of Assyria,
   made war upon the kingdom of Israel and carried a large number of the
   people (chiefly those of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh) into
   captivity, 2 Kgs 15:29; 1 Chr 5:26, and the residue remained under
   their own king, but paid tribute to the

   Prisoners before Sargon. (Nineveh Marbles.)

   Assyrian government. After the lapse of 20 years this tribute was
   refused, and therefore Shalmaneser besieged and (after three years)
   Sargon captured Samaria, the capital of the kingdom, and the great mass
   of the people were transported to provinces beyond the Euphrates, b.c.
   721. Their fate is a frequent subject of speculation, but nothing
   definite can be determined. Nor was the kingdom of Judah long left
   unmolested.

   Jewish Captives before Darius. (From Ancient Bas-relief at Fersepolis.
   )

   In Hezekiah's reign Sennacherib, king of Assyria, took the fenced
   cities of Judah, b.c. 713, and would have taken Jerusalem had Hezekiah
   not sent him a heavy tribute. 2 Kgs 18:13. His next attempt on the
   city, which occurred some little time after, was defeated by a miracle.
   2 Kgs 19:35.

   Nebuchadnezzar repeatedly overran the kingdom of Judah, the first time
   in the third year of Jehoiakim. He carried a few captives to Babylon,
   among whom were Daniel and his companions, b.c. 606. 2 Kgs 24:1; Dan
   1:1-4. In the tenth or eleventh year of Jehoiakim he came again, b.c.
   698, 2 Chr 36:6, and a third time in the eighth year of the reign of
   Jehoiachin. This invasion resulted in the carrying away of 10,000 Jews.
   2 Kgs 24:10-16. The 70 years' captivity began when Nebuchadnezzar, for
   the fourth time, invaded Judea, b.c. 588. 2 Kgs 25:1. The king,
   Zedekiah, was taken, his sons slain, the temple burnt and the city
   despoiled, and the greater part of the population carried into
   Babylonia. Jer 52:8-13. During this long captivity the rite of
   circumcision was observed, the genealogical tables filled, distinctions
   of rank maintained, and thus the Jews retained their nationality
   intact.

   In b.c. 536 the Jews were allowed to return from Babylon by Cyrus, as a
   portion of them did under Zerubbabel, Ezr 2:2, and some time afterward
   under Ezra, Ezr 7:7, b.c. 468, and Nehemiah, Neh 7:66, b.c. 445. Those
   who remained in Assyria or scattered over the Roman empire, but kept up
   their national distinctions, were known as ""The Dispersion,"" John 7:36;
   1 Pet 1:1; Jas 1:1, and afterward were starting-points for
   Christianity.

   Children of the Captivity, Ezr 4:1, a common figure of speech, denoting
   those who were in captivity, or perhaps sometimes literally their
   posterity. Turn again, Ps 126:1, turn away, Jer 29:14, turn back, Zeph
   3:20, or bring again, Eze 16:63, the captivity, are figurative phrases,
   all referring to the Jewish nation in bondage and their return to
   Canaan.

   A similar expression is used in relation to individuals, as in Job
   42:10. The Lord turned the captivity of Job -that is, he released him
   from the unusual sufferings and perplexities to which he had been in
   bondage, and caused him to rejoice again in the favor of God. He led
   captivity captive, Eph 4:8, or ""he led those as his captives who had
   made captives of others,"" is a figurative allusion to the victory which
   our blessed Redeemer achieved over sin and death, by whom our ruined
   race are brought into bondage. Rom 8:21; Gal 4:24; Heb 2:15; 2 Pet
   2:19.","",1
880,Carbuncle,"CAR'BUNCLE. This term represents two Hebrew words. The first, Ex 28:17;
   Ex 39:10; Eze 28:13, meaning flashing like lightning, is supposed to be
   either the emerald or beryl, both of which are precious stones of a
   green color."" Thy gates of carbuncles,"" Isa 54:12, has reference to a
   stone shining like fire -- possibly a brilliant species of ruby.","",1
881,Carchemiish,"CARCHEMIISH, or CHAR'CHEMISH {citadel of Chemosh), a chief city of
   northern Syria, on the Euphrates, where a great and decisive battle was
   fought, in which Nebuchadnezzar defeated Pharaoh-necho, 2 Chr 35:20; 2
   Kgs 23:29; Jer 46:2, in b. c. 605. It was formerly identified with
   Circesium. Rawlinson placed it at Bir, near Hierapolis, on the

884,Carmel,"CAR'MEL (fruitful, or wooded). 1. One of the most noted mountains in

   Mount Carmel, from the Bey of Acre. {After Views of G. M. Powell.)

   Palestine, a range or ridge about 12 miles long, one end jutting into
   the Mediterranean Sea in a bold bluff over 500 feet high, extending
   thence southeast until it abruptly breaks off in an inland bluff over
   500 feet above the sea level. Its highest elevation, about 4 miles from
   the east end, is nearly 1740 feet. It is specially noted as being the
   scene of remarkable events in the history of Elijah and Elisha. 2 Kgs
   2:25; Gal 4:25. The scene of the famous contest between Elijah and the
   prophets of Baal, 1 Kgs 18:20-42, was near the east end of the ridge,
   at el-Mahrakah (i. e. ""burnt-offering""); a well is near, and a slippery
   path leads down to the Kishon, several hundred feet below. This stream
   is now called Nahr el-Mukatta, ""river of slaughter,"" in memory of this
   event. It is a sacred mountain alike to Jews, Christians, and Moslems,
   and formerly swarmed with monks and hermits. One tract, known as the
   Monk's Cavern, has hundreds of caves, and a little below is the
   traditional cave of Elijah. On the mountain is the large monastery of
   the Carmelites, which affords hospitable accommodation and a
   magnificent view. It is now occupied by eighteen monks. The German
   colony of Haifa has recently planted vineyards on Mount Carmel.

   Present Appearance. -- Carmel is covered with a profusion of
   vegetation, illustrating ""the excellency of Carmel."" Isa 35:2. It is
   still known as Kurmul and Mar Elyas (Mount St. Elias). The rugged sides
   of the ridge are of hard, dark stone, always steep, often precipitous,
   covered with shrubs of dark, rich green. These shrubs are chiefly a
   kind of pistachio with no berries, the sponge laurel, the hawthorn, and
   the arbutus. The bare spots are covered with flowers, as rock-roses,
   striped asphodel, the daisy, and the red and purple anemone. The horse
   of the traveller often presses out a sweet fragrance from the thyme and
   mint. Herds of goats are frequently seen climbing its steep sides, and
   occasionally a gazelle bounds through the shrubs, while the fox,
   jackal, wolf, and a stray wild boar and a panther (chetah) add to the
   animal life of the mountains. The partridge and woodcock also abound.
   Huge valleys upward of 1000 feet deep wind tortuously from the main
   ridge to the sea, requiring hours to cross to the opposite summits. The
   rock is a compact, sandy limestone.

   Achan, the ""troubler of Israel."" Jos 7:1, 1 Sam 30:18.","",1
886,Carpenter,"CAR'PENTER . The first allusion to the carpenter's trade in the
   Scriptures occurs in the command to Noah to build the ark. Gen 6:14-16,
   and the directions here given presuppose quite a considerable skill.
   The second time the trade is mentioned is in the description of the
   setting up of the tabernacle in the wilderness, Ex 25:23; Ex 27:1-15,
   where various kinds of wood-work -the ark, the table, the altar, the
   acacia boards, etc. -are spoken of. From this point and throughout the
   holy writings frequent mention is made of this trade; and though it
   appears that both David, 2 Sam 5:11, and Solomon, 1 Kgs 5:6, employed
   foreign artisans, the numerous allusions, in the historical,
   prophetical, and poetical books of the O.T., to the tools, implements,
   and methods of this trade, show that the native craftsmen must have
   been possessed of great skill, and the trade itself held in high esteem
   among the people.

   Joseph, the husband of Mary, was a carpenter, Matt 13:55, and our L?ord
   himself worked at the trade, Mark 6:3. ""Is not this the carpenter's
   son?"" yea, ""Is not this the carpenter?"" asked the people, not in
   contempt, but in wonder. They implied, however, that they regarded him
   as one of themselves, as no better than they. But we may be thankful
   that our Lord is thus called, for the very word ""is full of meaning,
   and has exercised a very noble and blessed influence over the fortunes
   of mankind. It has tended to console and sanctify the estate of
   poverty, to ennoble the duty of labor, to elevate the entire conception

   as temporary dwelling-places. Gen 19:36; as places of concealment, Josh

902,Cedar,"CE'DAR. Undoubtedly several cone-bearing, evergreen trees are included
   under this title. But ordinarily, and especially when the full form is
   given ncedar of Lebanonn the still famous tree of that name (Cedrus
   Libani) is meant. The Scriptures correctly give its characteristics.
   Comp. Ps 92:12; Eze 31:3-6; 1 Kgs 7:2; Neh 10:27; Song of Solomon 4:11;
   Hos 14:6; Isa 2:13; Isa 10:19. It is one of the most valuable and
   majestic evergreen trees of Eastern forests, and is found upon Mounts
   Amanus and Taurus, in Asia Minor, and other parts of the Levant, but in
   its greatest perfection on Mount Lebanon. It grows to the height of 70
   or 80 feet. The branches are thick and long, spreading out almost
   horizontally from the trunk, which is sometimes 30 or 40 feet in
   circumference. Eze 31:3, 1 Chr 24:6, 1 Kgs 15:8. Maundrell measured one
   which was 36 feet and 6 inches in the girth, and 111 feet in the spread
   of its boughs. The wood is of a red color and bitter taste, which is
   offensive to insects, and hence it is very durable and admirably
   adapted for building. A specimen of this wood in the British Museum is
   labelled ""Cedar of Lebanon, from Palace of Nimrod; 3000 years old.""
   Cedar was used for the most noble and costly edifices, as the palace of
   Persepolis, the palace of Solomon, and the temple at Jerusalem. This
   timber served not only for beams for the frame and boards for covering
   buildings, but was also wrought into the walls. 2 Sam 7:2; 1 Kgs 6:36
   and Num 7:12. The gum which exudes from the trunk and the cones is as
   soft and fragrant as the balsam of Mecca.

   This tree, there is reason to believe, once quite covered the mountains
   of Lebanon between the heights of 3000 and 7000 feet. Rev. H. H. Jessup
   has visited and described eleven distinct groves of cedars on those
   mountains, including, altogether, several thousand trees.

   The principal forest visited by travellers is 8 hours' ride from
   Baalbec, on Cedar Mountain (Jebel el-Arz), about 6300 feet above the
   sea-level, a little below the summit. Baedeker (Palestine and Syria, p.
   505) thus describes it: ""The group occupies the top of a hill with five
   culminating points of various sizes, on the eastern and western sides
   of which runs a water-course. It consists of about 350 trees, the
   tallest of which does not exceed 78 feet in height. The rock on which
   they grow is white limestone, and the decaying spines, cones, and other
   matter have formed a dark-colored soil. The oldest trees, about 9 in
   number, are on the southeastern height. In the midst of the
   north-western group stands a Marnmite

   Cedars of Lebanon. (After Photographs.)

   chapel. Unfortunately, no care whatever is taken of these noble trees.
   The goats eat all the young shoots, and cedar branches are even used
   for fuel, particularly on the occasion of an annual festival in August.
   Countless names are cut on the trunks of the trees. ... In gloomy
   weather the sombre group and its black surroundings form a weird and
   wild picture.""

   In most of the botanic gardens and arboretums of Europe and America
   growing specimens of this monarch of Eastern forests may now be seen.
   It thrives especially well in England. In the general appearance of its
   bark and foliage it is much like the larch, but it is a far more
   widely-branching and massive tree.

   Dr. G. E. Post, of Beirfit, Syria, who is a good botanist, supplies the
   following interesting information concerning this tree: ""The first
   mention of the cedar in the Bible is in Lev 14:4, 1 Chr 24:6, Lev
   14:49, Jer 25:51, 2 Kgs 5:52, with the parallel passage. Num 19:6. The
   children of Israel were then in the peninsula of Mount Sinai. Did the
   cedar grow in that region? or is the cedar there alluded to a different
   tree from the cedar of Lebanon?

   ""There are other trees known now in Syria as cedars. The Aleppo pine is
   one, and it is quite probable that this tree may have grown in that
   region, although not more so than that the cedar itself was there. The
   juniper (Juniperus oxycedrus) still grows in the peninsula of Sinai;
   and being of the same family as the cedar, it is allowable to regard it
   as the plant here intended. A species of juniper is known in English by
   the name of 'cedar.' In view, however, of admitted changes in climate
   in all the countries bordering the eastern end of the Mediterranean,
   there is nothing to forbid the possibility of the cedar of Lebanon
   having once existed on Sinai. It grows on the Atlas chain and the
   mountains connecting Taurus with the Himalayas, as well as in the
   latter groups. May it not have found in Sinai a connecting station
   between its distant homes in the Atlas and the Lebanon and Himalayas?

   ""Some very foolish things have been said about the durability of the
   cedar. It has been pronounced, perhaps from trials on specimens taken
   from European or American trees, a crooked, inferior, perishable wood.
   In point of fact, it is notable for toughness, durability, and
   adaptedness to the climate and circumstances of Syria. There is no such
   thing as a rotten cedar. Branches broken off by the tempests lie
   unrotten on the ground. The trunks, where barked by travellers or
   peeled by the lightning, remain dead, but uncorrupted. The name of
   Lamartine, carved on one of the giant trees 109 years ago, is fresh and
   legible to-day. All other woods indigenous to Syria are liable to the
   attacks of insects or a kind of dry rot. Cedar beams are unchangeable.
   No greater injury has been done to Lebanon than denuding it of its
   kingly tree. The cedar is a desirable wood for carving. Isa 44:14. It
   is hard, fragrant, takes a high polish, which develops a beautiful
   grain, and it grows darker and richer by time.

   ""'The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which
   he hath planted.' Ps 104:16. The aromatic sap of this tree exudes from
   the slightest scratch, and distills in copal drops down the bark. If
   two branches rub together, they soon unite. Several trees are often
   joined in this way through the superabundance of their vitality.

   ""'The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a
   cedar in Lebanon.' A palm tree attains its height in a hundred years or
   less; a cedar grows for thousands of years. A palm tree soon bears
   fruit and flourishes; a cedar grows slowly and tarries long before it
   bears fruit, but it continues to bear fruit long centuries after the
   palm tree has decayed. It continues fat and flourishing (green). The
   cedar is ever green. Its vitality is equally apparent in the heat of
   summer and the snows of winter. How apt a likeness of the righteous,
   who grows in grace as he lengthens out his years! The cedar still bears
   multitudes of cones when it has been riven by lightning, torn and
   almost uprooted by the wind. So affliction but develops the graces of
   the righteous, and the green branches bear abundance of fruit when the
   blighted ones have been severed and for ever lost."" See Lebanon.","",1

   hand, and the incense was carried in the other hand. The priest strewed
   the pulverized incense upon the fire, and the cloud of smoke ascended
   up in a dark volume and filled the apartment with its fragrance. The
   word rendered ""censer"" in Heb 9:4 means a golden altar of incense.","",1
909,Census,"CEN'SUS. In the O.T. there is mention made of twelve censuses.

   1.The earliest was under Moses, in the third or fourth month after the
   Exodus. Its object was to raise money for building the tabernacle, each
   person numbered ni. e. every male from 20 years and upward nbeing
   obliged to pay half a shekel. The census showed there were 603,550 men.
   Ex 38:26. 2. In Num 1:2 there is the order for a second numbering, in
   the second month of the second year after the Exodus. The result showed
   the same figures. Num 1:46. This fact has led some to suppose that
   these two numberings were in fact one, but applied to different
   purposes. 3. The next census was made immediately before the entrance
   of the Hebrews into Canaan. Num 26. The total number of males fit for
   military service was 601,730, while the Levite males from a month old
   were 23,000. 4. For a long time after that there was no reckoning made.
   But David, instigated by Satan, out of mere curiosity and ambition to
   know how large a people he governed, ordered a count, which showed that
   the men of Israel over 20 years of age were 800,000, and of Judah
   500,000. 2 Sam 24:9; 1 Chr 21:1. These are round figures, and do not
   quite agree with those of 1 Chr 21:5. 5. Solomon completed the census
   by causing the foreigners and remnants of the conquered nations
   resident within Palestine to be numbered. 2 Chr 2:17-18.

   We read of much more frequent censuses after this:6. Rehoboam, 1 Kgs
   12:21; 7. Abijam, 2 Chr 13:3, 17; 8. Asa, 2 Chr 14:8-9; 9. Jehoshaphat.
   2 Chr 17:14-19; 10. Amaziah, 2 Chr 25:5-6; 11. Uzziah, 2 Chr 26:13. All
   these must have kept at least an account of how many could bear arms,
   since we find in the passages cited the number of their troops.
   Besides, the numbers referred to are those of the separate tribes and
   companies ne. g. Jud 7:3; 1 Kgs 20:15; Jer 52:30. 12. The last general
   census was that made at the time of the Return. Ezr 2:64 and Ezr 8:1-14
   give the numbers of males in the first and second caravan. These
   figures indicate the importance attached to the census, though no
   scientific use was made of it, as by us. It would appear that the
   kingdom of Judah was most populous under Jehoshaphat. The numbers, in
   proportion to the area of the country, have been quoted as an objection
   to the narrative. But while it must be freely granted that the
   population was dense, still the density has been paralleled, and even
   exceeded, in modern times. Palestine, it should be remembered, was a
   very fertile land. On the census of Cyrenius, Luke 2:2, see Taxing,

914,Chains,"CHAINS . A distinction must be made between fetters, which were for the
   feet, and chains, which were for any part of the body. Chains were worn
   for ornament, dignity, or restraint. They were made of gold for the
   first two purposes, and of iron for the last. In the ancient Orient
   both sexes wore them ostentatiously. They were put on Joseph and Daniel
   as a symbol of sovereignty. Gen 41:42; Dan 6:29. So to-day kings wear
   the chain of the order of the Golden Fleece. Chains were put by the
   Midianites upon their camels. Jud 8:21. They were also worn by women as
   a fastening between the anklets. Isa 3:19. The chains used on
   prisoners, Jud 16:21;2 Sam 3:34; 2 Kgs 25:7; Jer 39:7; Jer 52:11, were
   fetters. Handcuffs were also used. The Roman practice was to bind the
   prisoner's hand to the hand of a soldier, or to a soldier by either
   hand. Acts 12:6-7; Job 21:33; Acts 28:16, Ruth 4:20; 2 Tim 1:16.

   The ""chains"" which bound the madman of Gadara, Mark 5:3-4, were

916,Chaldaea,"CHALDAE'A, a country anciently situated on both sides of the river
   Euphrates, and bordering on the Persian Gulf. It had an estimated area
   of 23,000 square miles, about the same as the modern kingdom of
   Denmark, or half that of Louisiana in the Mississippi Delta. In later
   times, and in a more extended sense, it included a territory about 450
   miles long by 100 to 130 miles wide. It occupied the southern portion
   of the great Mesopotamian plain, the most fertile part of that country.
   It was rendered still more productive by numerous canals, which were
   used for defence, for commerce, and for navigation. The country was
   naturally divided into two portions, the larger part lying between the
   rivers Tigris and Euphrates, and the smaller portion lying on the
   southwestern side of the latter river. It was also divided into
   Northern and Southern Chaldaea, each having four important cities. In
   later times the ""land of the Chaldaeans"" was applied to all Babylonia,
   and to the whole of the empire over which the Chaldaeans ruled.

   Physical Features and Products. -The chief features of the country were
   the rivers, for on all sides it was a dead level, broken now only by
   solitary mounds, old ruins, marshes, and streams. The summers are hot,
   the winters rainy, and seldom colder than 30F. Wheat, millet, barley,
   dates, and fruits of all kinds were abundant. Its fertility and
   productions were proverbial in ancient times. For sketch-map of
   Chaldaea, see Assyria.

   History. -It is noticed in Scripture as the native country of Abram,
   Gen 11:31; its people attacked Job, Job 1:17, and it was the term by
   which the empire of Nebuchadnezzar was sometimes called. Originally it
   was the district in the south of the ""land of Shinar"" where Nimrod
   built four cities. Gen 10:10. Chaldaea soon extended its influence and
   sway, until in the time of Abraham its conquests reached nearly to the
   sources of the Euphrates, and westward into Canaan and Syria. Among the
   four great kingdoms or empires on the Euphrates, secular historians
   usually place the Chaldaean as the first in order or earliest, lasting
   for about ten centuries, from b.c. 2300 to about b.c. 1300; the
   Assyrian empire next, lasting about six and a half centuries, from b.c.
   1270 to b.c. 625; the Babylonian empire third in order, continuing from
   about b.c. 625 to B.C. 538; and the Medo-Persian fourth. Some of these
   kingdoms in their earlier history no doubt existed contemporaneously
   for a time. Chaldaea and Assyria were at times independent of each
   other; hence the order given above applies chiefly to them as empires.
   The great cities of the Chaldaean empire were Ur, Ellasar, Babylon,
   Erech, Accad, Calneh, Sepharvaim, Ahava, and Cutha. Its great rulers
   were Nimrod, Urukh, and Chedorlaomer. The latter marched an army for
   1200 miles on a conquering tour to the Dead Sea, and held Canaanitish
   nations in subjection for 12 years. Gen 10:9; Gen 14:1-4, The
   Chaldaeans, according to Rawlinson and others, were chiefly of Cushite
   origin, while their more northern neighbors were Semitic. After the
   lapse of centuries the former lost their Cushite character, and became
   a people scarcely distinguishable from the Assyrians. After their
   subjugation, in b.c. 1300, they held an insignificant place in history
   for over six centuries, but recovered themselves in b.c. 625, and
   established a new kingdom, known as the Babylonian empire. For the
   later history see Babylon, Assyria, and Nineveh.","",1

Guest-chamber. Mark 14:14, This we may suppose to have been a spacious
   unoccupied room, usually in the upper part of the house, and furnished
   suitably for the reception and entertainment of guests and for social

   darts forth its long tongue, covered with a viscous fluid, to entrap
   passing insects. Each foot is a grasping hand, by which it clings with
   great force to a branch, but it is almost helpless on the ground. The
   chief peculiarity of this lizard is the enormous size of the lungs
   (whence arose the fable that it lived on air), and these, when filled,
   render the animal semi-transparent. It has the faculty of changing
   color more developed than in any other lizard, and this change is
   influenced, not by the bodies on which it happens to rest, but by the
   wants and passions of the animal. The structure of the eyes is very
   wonderful. They are so prominent that one-half of the ball projects out
   of the head, and not only can they be moved in any direction, but each
   has an independent action:one eye may be looking forward, while with

   Joseph's exaltation, Gen 41:43, and meeting with his father, Gen 46:29;
   Ahab's fleeing before the coming storm at the command of Elijah, 1 Kgs
   18:44; Naaman's coming to Elisha, 2 Kgs 5:9; and the Ethiopian eunuch's
   journey homeward. Acts 8:28. But the commoner use was for war. They are
   first mentioned in the Bible in connection with Joseph in Egypt. Later
   on they formed part of Pharaoh's pursuing army at the Exodus. And they
   were part of the offensive weapons among all nations which figure in
   Bible history. The use of war-chariots was introduced by David. 2 Sam
   8:4. This change was obedient to the altered condition of the people,
   from a democracy, which relies upon volunteers for its defence, to a
   monarchy, which employs a regular army. Solomon had 1400 chariots, and
   cities fortified for their safe-keeping. 1 Kgs 10:26; 1 Chr 9:19. After
   his day they formed a regular branch of the military service, and are
   frequently mentioned. 1 Kgs 22:34; 2 Kgs 9:16,2 Chr 11:21; 2 Kgs 13:7,
   2 Kgs 22:14; 2 Kgs 18:24; 2 Kgs 23:30; Isa 31:1. The texts just

   Egyptian Chariot. (After Wilkinson.)

   quoted also prove that Egypt was the source whence both the
   chariot-horses and the chariots themselves were principally drawn. A
   description of an Egyptian chariot will therefore be a description of a
   Jewish one. The Egyptian chariot was an ""almost semicircular wooden
   frame with straightened sides, resting posteriorly on the axle of a
   pair of wheels, a rail of wood or ivory being attached to the frame by
   leathern thongs, and a wooden upright in front. The back of the car was
   open, and the sides were strengthened and embellished with leather and
   metal binding; the floor was of rope net-work, to give a springy
   footing to the occupants. On the off-side were the bowcase, sometimes
   the quiver, and spearcase, crossing diagonally; the last named inclined
   backward. If two warriors were in the chariot, there was a second
   bow-case. The wheels had usually six spokes, fastened to the axle by a
   linchpin, secured by a thong. The horses had a breast-band and girths
   attached to the saddle, but were without traces. They wore
   head-furniture, often ornamented, with a bearing-rein. The
   driving-reins passed through rings on each side of both horses. Two
   persons generally were in a chariot, but there was sometimes a third,
   holding the umbrella of state."" - Wilkinson: Anc. Egypt., 1879, vol. i.
   pp.222-241: vol.ii. pp. 201-203. The Assyrian warchariots were nearly
   similar. Sometimes a third horse was attached, but in later times this
   was laid aside; the chariot was made higher, and the quiver placed in
   front instead of on the side. - Layard: Nineveh, vol. ii. pp. 348-354;
   Ayre: Treas. of Bib. Knowledge.

   Chariots armed with scythes were used in later times. Warriors
   sometimes fought standing up in them, or else used them to carry them
   into the battle, and leaping from them fought on foot.

   The word ""chariot"" is sometimes used figuratively; e.g. in Ps 68:17 it
   means the angelic host. Elisha called Elijah ""the chariot of Israel and
   the horsemen thereof."" 2 Kgs 2:12. The imagery was borrowed from the
   phenomena of the miraculous ascent. The phrase means that Elijah, by
   his prayers and his counsels, was the true defence of Israel, and
   better than either chariots or horsemen.

   Captains of Chariots. The phrase occurs in Ex 14:7; Ex 15:4; 1 Kgs
   22:33. In the first two passages it means ""commanders of the highest
   rank, chosen specially to attend on the person of Pharaoh; probably
   commanders of the 2000 Calasirians, who, alternately with the
   Hermotybians, formed his body-guard. They may have been, for the most

   Chariots of the Sun. It was a Persian practice to dedicate a chariot
   and horses to the sun. These chariots were white, and drawn probably by
   white horses in sacred processions. This idolatrous practice found
   favor in Judah, for it is recorded, to the honor of Josiah and as a
   proof of his zeal, that he took away the horses which previous kings
   had given to the sun, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 2

   The cherubim were not angels, since altogether different occupations
   are given to them in the Bible. Thus angels are sent out upon messages,
   but the cherubim always are in the presence of God. They are winged,
   and are in appearance like combinations of parts of different animals.
   The word first occurs in Gen 3:24, and is applied to the guard which
   was placed over Eden after the expulsion of fallen man.

   ""It is remarkable that while there are precise directions as to their
   position, attitude, and material, Ex 26:18, etc., and descriptions, 2
   Chr 3:10-13, nothing is said about their shape, except that they were
   winged. On the whole, it seems likely that the word 'cherub' meant not
   only the composite creature

   Egyptian Winged Figures.

   form, of which the man, lion, ox, and eagle were the elements, but,
   further, some peculiar and mystical form."" -Smith:Dictionary of the
   Bible.

   According to the primitive conception, the cherubim were the bearers of
   God when he appeared in his glory upon the earth, Ps 18:10; so, in
   Ezekiel's vision, they carry the throne of God. Eze 11:22; cf. Eze
   1:19; Neh 10:16 ff. They are the ""wings of the wind,"" by which God in
   the thunder-cloud is borne to the world. Isa 19:1; Ps 104:3. Hence they
   are the witnesses of his presence: wherever they are, God is. How
   appropriately, therefore, were representations of them placed in the
   tabernacle and temple! In the former, two golden cherubim stood in the
   holy of holies, upon the mercy-seat. Ex 37:8. They were likewise
   pictured upon the curtains. Ex 26:1, 1 Chr 24:31; Ex 36:8, Ex 28:35. In
   Solomon's temple two colossal figures of the cherubim, overlaid with
   gold, stood upon the floor and overshadowed the ark, which was between
   them, in the holy of holies. 1 Kgs 6:27. They were also carved upon the
   doors, upon all the ""walls of the house,"" and put between
   representations of palm trees. 1 Kgs 6:29, Jud 1:32, Ex 28:35; 2 Chr
   3:7. Indeed, in all parts did they constitute, with lions, oxen, and
   palm trees, the ornamentation of the temple. 1 Kgs 7:29, Eze 23:36. The
   cherubim, therefore, testified that God was in the midst of his people.

   A second idea which they represent is that they were the watchers of
   the places where God is. They cover his glory from vulgar gaze; they
   stand in the service of the invisible and the unapproachable God. Comp.
   Ex 19:9, Ex 17:16; Gen 24:15.

   Similar winged creatures are met with in great variety in the legends
   and symbols of other peoples of antiquity, but the originality of the
   Hebrew cherubim is not to be disputed. Still, the forms which they
   assumed may have been in part derived from these nations. Very
   interesting is the comparison of the Hebrew cherubim with figures in
   the Egyptian and Assyrian temples.","",1

   the people threw their voluntary contributions for the repair of the
   temple under Joash. But the original word in every other place except
   Gen 50:26, where it is applied to Jacob's coffin, means the ark of the
   covenant. A different word altogether is used for Noah's and Moses's
   ""ark."" The second word occurs only in Eze 27:24, and means a

   lyciarch, etc. The title is properly ""asiarch,"" and was borne, it would
   seem, after the duties of the office had been discharged. This explains

   children of Israel,"" ""the children of God."" It was regarded among the
   Jews as not only a misfortune, but even a disgrace, if a married woman
   was barren. The more sons a man had, the more was he esteemed. The
   inheritance of the father was divided equally among all the sons,
   except the eldest, who received a double portion. The daughters got
   nothing unless there was no son, in which case they shared equally the
   property, and were forbidden to marry out of their father's tribe. Num
   27:7-12; Num 35:2, 1 Kgs 15:8. Wills were needless, and therefore
   unknown. The authority of the parent was very great, and children are
   commanded to reverence their parents. The law allowed children to be
   sold into bondage in payment of the parents' debts. Lev 25:39-41. We
   find allusions to the practical working of this law in 2 Kgs 4:1 and
   Matt 18:25.

   Child-birth in Eastern countries is usually, although not always,
   comparatively easy. Gen 35:17; Gen 38:27; Ex 1:19; 1 Sam 4:19-20. The
   newborn Hebrew child was washed, rubbed with salt, and wrapped in
   swaddling clothes, Luke 2:7; circumcised on the eighth day, when the
   name was given. Child-birth rendered the woman ceremonially unclean for
   40 days in the case of a son, and 80 in the case of a daughter. At the
   conclusion of the period she offered for her cleansing the sacrifices
   the Law prescribed. Lev 12. Women nursed their own children in most
   cases, and did not wean them until the lapse of 30 months, or even 3
   years. The weaning was made a festive occasion. This custom was very
   old. Gen 21:8. Daughters remained under the care of the mother until

   fix its site at Kerdzeh, 2 1/2 miles west of Tell Hum, and west of the
   valley of the Jordan. The ruins cover a large area, and consist of a
   synagogue, the ornaments being cut in black basalt rock, walls of

   Chezib and Achzib, but Conder places Chozeba at a ruin of importance in
   Wady Arnib, or valley of Berachoth, and called Kueiztbah, a name which
   is almost the exact equivalent for the Hebrew Chozeba.","",1
990,Christ,"CHRIST, JE'SUS . Matt 1:1. Christ is the official, Jesus the personal,
   name of our Lord. It is from the Greek word Christos, which signifies
   ""anointed,"" corresponding to the word Messiah in the Hebrew. He is
   called the Anointed in allusion to the custom of anointing with oil
   such as were set apart to a sacred or regal office, because by the
   Spirit he was anointed to the threefold office of prophet, priest, and
   king.

   The word ""Jesus"" is derived from a Hebrew word signifying ""to save,"" or
   ""sent to save."" Matt 1:21; Luke 2:11,2 Chr 11:21. The word ""Joshua"" has
   the same meaning, and is a very common name among the Hebrews, and
   should have been used in Acts 7:45 and Heb 4:8 instead of ""Jesus.""

   Jesus the Christ is a descriptive phrase, like John the Baptist. Matt
   26:63; Mark 8:29; Mark 14:61; John 1:20, Gal 4:25, 1 Chr 4:41; John
   6:69; John 7:41; John 10:24; John 11:27; John 20:31. The word ""Jesus""
   is almost always used alone in the Gospels, while, in the Acts and
   Epistles, ""Jesus Christ "" or ""Lord Jesus Christ"" is the prevailing
   expression.

   The first promise of the Messiah was given in Gen 3:16. The Son of God
   and all true believers are ""the seed of the woman."" Comp. Acts 13:23;
   Gal 4:4, and Heb 2:16 with John 17:21,Heb 12:23. The devil and all his
   servants represent the serpent and his seed. John 8:44; 1 John 3:8. The
   temptations, sufferings, and ignominious death of Christ, and the
   fierce opposition and persecution which his followers have endured, are
   significantly described by the bruising of the heel; while the complete
   victory which our Redeemer has himself achieved over sin and death, and
   which his grace enables the believer also to obtain, and the still more
   perfect and universal triumph which he will finally accomplish, are all
   strikingly illustrated by the bruising or crushing of the serpent's
   head.

   The books of heathen mythology furnish curious allusions to this
   passage of the Bible. In one of them Thor is represented as the eldest
   son of Odin, a middle divinity, a mediator between God and man, who
   bruised the head of the serpent and slew him. And in one of the oldest
   pagodas of India are found two sculptured figures, representing two
   incarnations of one of their supreme divinities, the first to be bitten
   by a serpent and the second to crush him.

   The promise thus given when man fell was supplemented by so many
   particulars in the course of the centuries that the coming Messiah was
   the great hope of Israel. In type and symbol, in poetry and prose, in
   prophecy and history, the Jews had set before them in increasing
   prominence and clearness the character and life and death of the
   promised Messiah, and yet, as a nation, they grossly misapprehended his
   character and the purpose of his mission. They were accustomed to
   regard his coming as the grand era in the annals of the world, for they
   spoke of the two great ages of history, the one as preceding and the
   other as following this wonderful event; but they perverted the
   spiritual character of the Messiah and his kingdom into that of a
   temporal deliverer and ruler.

   We find that about the time of the Messiah's appearance Simeon, Anna,
   and others of like faith, were eagerly expecting the promised
   salvation. Luke 2:25-38.

   At the appointed time the Redeemer of the world appeared. He was born
   in the year of the city of Rome 749 -i.e. 4 years before the beginning
   of our era- at Bethlehem, in Judea, of the Virgin Mary, who was
   espoused to Joseph; and through them he derived his descent from David,
   according to prophecy. Ps 89:3-4 and Ps 110:1. Comp. Acts 2:25, Eze
   23:36; Isa 11:1-10; Jer 23:5-6; Eze 34:23-24; Eze 37:24-25; John 7:42.
   The story of Christ's life is told with so much simplicity,
   completeness, and sweetness in the Gospels, and is at the same time so
   familiar to every Bible-reader, that it is not necessary here to repeat
   it. In one sentence, Jesus Christ was the incarnate God, whose coming
   was the fulfillment of prophecy; whose life was the exemplification of
   absolute sinlessness; whose death was the result of man's malice, and
   yet the execution of God's design and the atonement for the sins of the
   world; whose resurrection was the crowning proof of his divinity; whose
   ascension was a return to his abode, where he ever liveth to make
   intercession for us. To prove his character we have the unanimous
   testimony of eighteen centuries. ""The person of Christ is the miracle
   of history.""

   We claim for him perfect humanity and perfect divinity. He was not only
   the Son of man, but the Son of God in one undivided person. The term
   ""Son of man,"" which Christ applies to himself about eighty times in the
   Gospels, places him on a common level with other men as partaking of
   their nature and constitution, and at the same time above all other men
   as the absolute and perfect Man, the representative Head of the race,
   the second Adam. Comp, Rom 5:12 ff.; 1 Cor 15:27; Heb 1:8. While other
   great men are limited by national prejudice, Christ is the King of men,
   who draws all to him; he is the universal, absolute Man, elevated above
   the limitations of race and nationality. And yet he is most intensely
   human. The joys and sorrows of our common life are met by his deep and
   tender sympathy. All love him who know him. His foes are the cruel, the
   licentious, and the malicious. The records of the evangelists are not
   elaborate, artistic pages with many erasures, as if the writers had
   toiled after consistency. They are simple, straight-forward, guileless
   testimonies; and yet the impression they leave upon the attentive
   reader is that in Jesus Christ the plant of Humanity bore its rarest
   flower, the tree of Life its most precious fruit. It will be granted
   that the question of the justice of this claim turns upon his perfect
   sinlessness. Some have dared to say that while in the Gospels no sinful
   acts are recorded, there may have been sins which are unrecorded. But
   without fear he challenged his foes to convict him of sin. John 8:46.
   He was the only man who has made any such demand. Christ's sinlessness
   is confirmed by his own solemn testimony, the whole course of his life,
   and the very purpose for which he appeared. Self-deception in this case
   would border on madness, falsehood would overthrow the whole moral
   foundation of Christ's character. Hypocrites do not maintain themselves
   under such a strain. But besides being sinless, he was perfectly holy.
   He did not simply resist sin; he blended and exercised actively all
   virtues. The grandeur of his character removes him at once from all the
   sordidness, pettiness, and sinfulness of our every-day life. His memory
   comes to us with the refreshment of the cooling breeze on a summer's
   day. We can supplicate his help because we have seen him tried and
   triumphant, and we know his strength is great. All human goodness loses
   on closer inspection, but Christ's character grows more pure, sacred,
   and lovely the better we know him.

   But Jesus was likewise the Son of God, and so he is usually called by
   the apostles. The perfection of his humanity if matched by the
   perfection of his divinity. His Godhead comes out in many ways. He
   exercises a supernatural control over Nature. The waves sink at his
   command, the fig tree withers away, the water turns into wine. By his
   touch or word, without a prayer or any recognition of superior power,
   the lepers are cleansed, the blind see, and the lame walk. Higher yet
   does Christ go; he forgives sins - not with the ostentation of a
   presuming charlatan, but simply, decidedly, gently. He takes from the
   sinner his damning load by the same action which brings back health. He
   likewise intercedes with the Father for men. He claims equality and
   eternity with God. Twice God proclaims him as his Son. Accompanied by
   legions of angels, sustained by divine strength, Jesus of Nazareth
   lives as the express image of the Father, conquers the grave, rises
   from the dead, and ascends to take his place as God, blessed for ever.

   The Church has the daily experience of her Lord, who is present always
   in the hearts of all true believers. When souls yearn for cheer, when
   mourners cry out for comfort, when men need counsel, they seek Jesus;
   and they are supplied from the inexhaustible fount of his humanity.
   When the sinner feels the burden of his sin pressing heavily and groans
   for release, when the insolvent debtor falls at the feet of his Lord,
   crying, ""Have mercy!"" when the saint is set amid the perplexities of
   life, when he enters the valley of the shadow of death, when he comes
   to the brink of the river, -these are times when the perfect divinity
   of Jesus is proven to the satisfaction of the soul.

   ""Behold the God-Man!"" cries the Church; and this is the exultant
   exclamation of the soul left to its deepest instincts and noblest
   aspirations, the soul which was originally made for Christ, and finds
   in him the solution of all moral problems, the satisfaction of all its
   wants, the unfailing fountain of everlasting life and peace.

   Personal Appearance of Jesus Christ. -None of the evangelists- not even
   the beloved disciple and bosom-friend of Jesus- has given us the least
   hint of his countenance and stature. This was wise. We ought to cling
   to the Christ in the spirit rather than to the Christ in the flesh. Yet
   there must have been spiritual beauty in his face. He won the hearts of
   his disciples by a word. We are indeed left to conjecture merely, but
   we cannot read in the hints of his personal power any necessity for
   taking Isaiah's description of the suffering Messiah in all its literal
   baldness. There was nothing repulsive about Jesus. He had not the
   physiognomy of a sinner; a supernatural purity and dignity must have
   shone through the veil of his flesh.

   The first formal description of his looks dates from the fourth
   century-is, indeed, unauthentic, probably a monkish fabrication, and
   yet, because it is curious and has had a great influence upon the
   pictorial representations of Jesus, we insert it here. It is ascribed
   to Publius Lentulus, a heathen, supposed contemporary and friend of
   Pilate, in an apocryphal letter to the Roman Senate: ""In this time
   appeared a man, who lives till now -a man endowed with great powers.
   Men call him a great prophet; his own disciples term him the Son of
   God. His name is Jesus Christ. He restores the dead to life and cures
   the sick of all manner of diseases. This man is of noble and well
   proportioned stature, with a face full of kindness, and yet firmness,
   so that beholders both love him and fear him. His hair is the color of
   wine, and golden at the root, straight and without lustre, but from the
   level of the ears curling and glossy, and divided down the centre,
   after the fashion of the Nazarenes, His forehead is even and smooth,
   his face without blemish, and enhanced by a tempered bloom, his
   countenance ingenuous and kind. Nose and mouth are in no way faulty.
   His beard is full, of the same color as his hair, and forked in form;
   his eyes blue and extremely brilliant. In reproof and rebuke he is
   formidable; in exhortation and teaching, gentle and amiable of tongue.
   None have seen him to laugh, but many, on the contrary, to weep. His
   person is tall, his hands beautiful and straight. In speaking be is
   deliberate and grave and little given to loquacity; in beauty,
   surpassing most men.""

   It may be proper to suggest the leading points and principal references
   respecting the divinity of our Lord.

   We insert here, as a help in studying the harmony of the four Gospels,

   Commentary on the New Testament (New York, 1879), vol. i. p. 18.

   Outline of the Gospel History.

   The life of Christ has been of late studied with an eagerness, a
   keenness, and a wealth of illustration that argue well for the future.
   The question, ""What think ye of Christ?"" is asked to-day with peculiar
   emphasis. This new-born interest in the earthly life of the Founder of
   the Christian religion will bear fruit in the increased reverence of
   believers and the increased respect of his foes.

   Christs, False. Matt 24:24. Our Lord warned his disciples that false
   Christs should arise. Not less than 24 different persons of such
   pretensions have appeared, and the defence of their claims to the
   Messiahship has cost the Jews a great expense of life and treasure. One
   of them, Coziba, or Barchocheba, lived early in the second century. He
   put himself at the head of the Jewish nation as their Messiah; they
   adhered to him. The Romans made war upon him, and the Jews themselves
   allow that in their defence of this false Messiah they lost between
   500,000 and 600,000 souls! In the twelfth century not less than 8 or 10
   impostors appeared under the same name, and were followed by great
   numbers of the Jews. Most of them were punished for their imposture
   with death, and usually involved a multitude of their deluded followers
   in persecution and death. The last that gained any considerable number
   of converts was Mordecai, a Jew of Germany, who lived in 1682. He fled
   for his life, and his end is not known.","",1
991,Christian,"CHRIS'TIAN. Acts 26:28. This was a name given to the followers of our
   Saviour, and its proper beautiful meaning is ""a follower of Christ.""
   The Christians called themselves first ""disciples,"" ""believers,""
   ""brethren,"" ""saints."" The name ""Christian"" originated at Antioch. Acts
   11:26, about the year 42 or 43, and probably (like the names ""
   Nazarenes "" and ""Galilgeans "") as a term of reproach or contempt. The
   word occurs in only three places in the New Testament -viz. in the two
   passages before cited and in 1 Pet 4:16, where it is implied that the
   very name was associated with reproach and suffering. Tacitus (b. about
   a.d. 54), a profane historian, tells us of the low or vulgar people
   called the followers of Christ, or Christians.

   The term Christian is now employed (1) in contradistinction to pagans,
   Jews, and Mohammedans, and (2) to denote the open professors of
   religion, in contradistinction from those who are not professors. In
   some countries it is still a term of bitter reproach, and the
   assumption of it is attended with persecution, cruelty, and death.

   The Christian religion is received at the present day (as it is
   supposed) by nearly one-third of the inhabitants of the world -i. e.
   over 400,000,000 among 1,460,000,000. But in point of intelligence,
   civilization, and influence on the world the Christian nations far
   surpass all other nations combined. One of the most recent estimates is
   the following:


   Jews......................................7,000,000

   Mohammedans................230,000,000

   Pagans..............................793,000,000

   Roman Catholics..............216,000,000

   Protestants.......................130,000,000

   Eastern Christians.............84,000,000

   .......................................1,460,000,000","",1
992,Chronicles,"CHRON'ICLES . In its general signification, this term denotes a
   chronological history, or an account of facts and events in the order
   of time. The thirteenth and fourteenth books of the Old Testament,
   which among the ancient Jews formed only one book, are called the First
   and Second Book of Chronicles, and are in some sense supplemental to
   the two books of Kings, which precede them, with this difference -that
   the Chronicles are written from the sacerdotal point of view and
   present chiefly the fortunes of Jewish worship, while, the Kings are
   written from the prophetic view of the history of the theocracy. They
   appear to have been compiled from the national diaries or journals, and
   the constant Jewish tradition, which internal evidence supports, is
   that they were written by Ezra. These voluminous diaries are referred
   to frequently under different names, 1 Kgs 14:19; 1 Chr 27:24; Esth
   2:23, but are not to be confounded with the abstract which constitutes
   the books to which this article refers.

   The principal object of the author of these books was to point out,
   from the public records, the state of the different families before the
   Captivity and the distribution of the lands among them, that each tribe
   might, as far as possible, obtain the ancient inheritance of its
   fathers at its return. So that this portion of the Old Testament may be
   considered as an epitome of all the sacred history, but more especially
   of that from the origin of the Jewish nation to their return from the
   first captivity, embracing a period of nearly 3500 years. The first
   book traces the rise and propagation of the children of Israel from
   Adam, together with a circumstantial account of the reign and
   transactions of David; the second continues the narrative, and relates
   the progress and dissolution of the kingdom of Judaea (apart from
   Israel) to the year of the return of the people from Babylon. Samuel,
   Kings, and Chronicles should be read and compared together, as they
   relate substantially the same histories, though with different degrees
   of particularity and with different means of information, so that the
   whole contains but one history; and what is obscure or defective in one
   part may be explained or supplied in another.","",1
993,Chronology,"CHRONOLOGY. We present here a condensation of the article of R. S.
   Poole on this subject in Smith's Dictionary of the Bible.

   We must seek a via media between putting absolute reliance upon the
   biblical chronological data and declaring them altogether vague and
   uncertain. The truth is, the Bible does not give a complete history of
   the times to which it refers; in its historical portions it deals with
   special and detached periods. This accounts for its scantiness and
   occasional want of continuity. Hence there is great value in
   independent evidence in the N.T. and in incidental evidence in the O.T.

   Scientific observation of the natural changes of the weather and the
   seasons was probably unknown to the Jews until the Captivity. But still
   these changes must have been noted, and from these observations we are
   safe in deducing their divisions of time. An hour was the smallest
   division the Jews recognized. The ""sun-dial of Ahaz"" -whatever
   instrument, fixed or movable, it may have been- implies a division of
   the kind. The civil day was reckoned from sunset, the natural day from
   sunrise. The night was divided into three watches, though the first
   must be inferred. The ""middle watch"" occurs in Jud 7:19; the ""morning
   watch"" is mentioned in Ex 14:24 and 1 Sam 11:11. In the N.T. four
   watches are mentioned -the Roman system; all four are mentioned
   together in Mark 13:35 -the late watch, midnight, the cock-crowing, and
   the early watch. The Hebrew week was a period of seven days, ending
   with the Sabbath, which word indeed is often used for ""week."" As the
   Egyptians divided their month of 30 days into decades, the Hebrews
   could not have borrowed their week from them; probably both it and the
   Sabbath were used and observed by the patriarchs. The month was lunar.
   The first day of it is called the ""new moon,"" and was observed as a
   sacred festival. In the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth we find
   but one month, the first, the month Abib, mentioned with a special
   name, the rest being called according to their order. In 1 Kgs. three
   other names appear -Zif, the second, Ethanim, the seventh, and Bui, the
   eighth. No other names are found in any book prior to the Captivity.
   The year was made up of 12 lunar months, beginning with the first part
   of our April. The method of intercalation can only have been that which
   obtained after the Captivity -the addition of a thirteenth month
   whenever the twelfth ended too long before the equinox for the
   first-fruits of the barley-harvest to be offered in the middle of the
   month following, and the similar offerings at the time appointed. The
   later Jews had two beginnings to the year, the seventh month of the
   civil reckoning being Abib, the first of the sacred. The sabbatical and
   jubilee years began in the seventh month. Agricultural considerations
   probably led to this anomaly. The seasons do not appear to have been
   fixed among the ancient Hebrews. We find mention of the merely natural
   divisions of ""summer and winter,"" ""seed-time and harvest."" Anciently,
   their festivals and holy-days were noticeably few; for besides the
   Sabbaths and new moons, there were but four great festivals and one
   fast -the feasts of the Passover, of weeks, trumpets, tabernacles, and
   the fast on the day of atonement. But after the Captivity many holy
   days were added, such as the feast of Purim, of the dedication
   -recording the cleansing and rededication of the temple by Judas
   Maccabseus- and fasts on the anniversaries of great national
   misfortunes connected with the Babylonish captivity. The sabbatical
   year was a year of rest. It commenced at the civil beginning of the
   year, with the seventh month, at the feast of tabernacles. Deut 31:10.
   The jubilee year began on the day of atonement, after the lapse of
   seven sabbatical periods, or 49 years. It was similar to the sabbatical
   year in its character, although doubtless yet more important. Eras seem
   to have been used by the ancient Hebrews, but our information is
   scanty. The Exodus is used as an era in 1 Kgs 6:1, in giving the date
   of Solomon's temple. The era of Jehoiachin's captivity is constantly
   used by Ezekiel. The earliest date is the fifth year, Ezekiel 1:2, and
   the latest the twenty seventh Ezekiel 29:17. The era of the Seleucidae
   is used in the First and Second Maccabees, and the liberation of the
   Jews from the Syrian yoke, in the first year of Simon the Maccabee, is
   stated to have been commemorated by an era used in contracts and
   agreements. 1 Macc 13:41-42. Regnal years seem to have been counted
   from the beginning of the year, not from the day of the king's
   accession.

   We may distinguish different periods in Jewish history, although we are
   not able with accuracy to assign them dates. 1. From Adam to Abram's
   departure from Haran. This period is the most indefinite of all. We
   have indeed two genealogical lists -from Adam to Noah and his sons, Gen
   5:3-32, and again from Shem to Abram. Gen 11:10-26. But the Masoretic
   Hebrew text, the Septuagint, and the Samaritan Pentateuch greatly
   differ. The Septuagint makes this period 1000 years longer than the
   Hebrew. The question to which list the preference should be given is
   still unsettled. 2. The second period is from Abram's departure from
   Haran to the Exodus. The length of this period is stated by Paul in Gal
   3:17 to be 430 years, and there is no difficulty in the way of
   accepting his figures which cannot be solved. 3. The third period is
   from the Exodus to the foundation of Solomon's temple. We may consider
   this period about 638 years, but others reduce it to one-half. 4. The
   fourth period is from the foundation of Solomon's temple to its
   destruction. We come now upon tolerably sure ground; from b.c. 1000 on
   we have contemporary evidence. Two interregnums have been supposed -one
   of 11 years, between Jeroboam II and Zachariah, and the other of 9
   years, between Pekah and Hoshea. We prefer, in both cases, to suppose a
   longer reign of the earlier of the two kings between whom the
   interregnums are conjectured. The whole period may be held to be of
   about 425 years; that of the undivided kingdom, 120 years; that of the
   kingdom of Judah, about 388 years; and that of the kingdom of Israel,
   about 255 years. 5. The fifth period is from the destruction of
   Solomon's temple to the return from the Babylonish captivity. The
   difficulty in calculating this period springs from the prophesied
   number -the 70 years. Two numbers, held by some to be identical, must
   here be considered. One is the period of 70 years, during which the
   tyranny of Babylon over Palestine and the East generally was to last,
   Jer 25; and the other the 70 years of the Babylonish captivity. The
   commencement of the first is the first year of Nebuchadnezzar and the
   fourth of Jehoiakim, Jer 25:1, when the successes of the king of
   Babylon began, Jer 46:2, and the conclusion is the fall of Babylon. The
   famous 70 years of captivity would seem to be the same period, since it
   was to terminate with the return of the captives, Jer 29:10; and the
   order for this was published by Cyrus, who took Babylon, in the first
   year of his reign.

   Principal Systems of Biblical Chronology. -There are three, long,
   short, and Rabbinical. The long chronology takes the Septuagint for the
   patriarchal generations, and adopts the long interval from the Exodus
   to the foundation of Solomon's temple. The short chronology -that in
   the margin of the A.V., and derived from Archbishop Ussher (1580-1656)-
   takes the Hebrew for the patriarchal generations, and makes the second
   period to be 480 years. The Rabbinical chronology accepts the biblical
   numbers, but makes the most arbitrary corrections. We subjoin a table
   in which the results of some of the more important of the various
   chronological schools are contrasted:

   Celtic, and Slavonic languages) is derived from a Greek word
   (?KvpiaKov?) meaning ""belonging to the Lord"" (Christ), ""the Lord's
   house."" Some derive it from a Celtic root meaning ""round,"" because the
   temples in which the first Christian congregations gathered were
   circular. In the N.T. the original word is ecclesia, which means an
   assembly, either secular, Acts 19:32, or religious. Acts 2:47, etc. It
   is applied either to the whole body of believers in Christ, the Church
   universal. Matt 16:18 Eph 1:22, or to a particular congregation in a
   local sense, as ""the church at Jerusalem,"" Acts 15:4; ""at Antioch,""
   Acts 13:1, ""of the Thessalonians,"" 2 Thess 1:1, ""at Corinth,"" 1 Cor
   1:2. The original word is used only twice in the Gospels, each time by
   Matthew 1 Cor 16:18, where it means the Church universal, and Josh
   18:17, where it means a local congregation. The evangelists usually
   employ the term ""the kingdom of God"" or ""the kingdom of heaven"" for the
   spiritual substance of the Church universal.

   The day of Pentecost is the birthday of the Christian Church. From
   small beginnings it has spread over all the earth and been the one
   permanent fact amid all temporal changes. To-day it is the foundation
   of true civilization, virtue, and religion. What the Christian Church
   condemns the world must eventually give up, for darkness cannot abide
   the entrance of light.

   A distinction must be made between the real Church of Christ, the
   genuine believers, and the outward organization, which comprises both
   true and false friends of Christ. To the former only do the promises
   belong.

   In the outward sense the Church is divided into various denominations,
   as the Baptist, the Congregational, the English, the Episcopal, the
   Greek, the Lutheran, the Methodist, the Moravian, the Presbyterian, the
   Reformed, the Roman, and other churches. But in the Bible the word is

1006,Circumcision,"CIRCUMCIS'ION (cutting round), a rite or ceremony of the Jewish
   religion, which consisted in cutting oflf the foreskin of all males on
   the eighth day after their birth. It was established as the token of
   God's covenant with Abraham, Gen 17:9-14, who immediately subjected
   himself and all his family to its observance. The precept of
   circumcision was renewed to Moses, Ex 12:44; Lev 12:3; John 7:22-23,
   requiring that all should submit to it who would partake of the paschal
   sacrifice. The Jews have always been very scrupulous in its observance,
   though it was omitted in their journey through the wilderness for some
   reason. Many other nations have the rite. It existed among the
   Egyptians, the Ethiopians, the Mexicans, and the West Indians, and
   to-day among the Caffres of South Africa, the Abyssinians, the
   islanders of the Pacific Ocean, and the South American tribes. It is
   the chief ceremony of initiation into the religion of Mohammed, though
   it is regarded only as a traditionary precept, and is not performed
   till the child is 13 years old. The instrument used for this purpose
   was a knife, a razor, or even a sharp stone. Ex 4:25; Josh 5:3.

   The design of this requirement obviously was to fix upon the persons of
   all the natural male descendants of Abraham a distinguishing mark,
   separating them from all the rest of the world. As this rite was
   peculiar to the Jews, they are called ""the circumcision,"" and the
   Gentiles ""the uncircumcision."" Rom 4:9 . The terms ""uncircumcised"" and
   ""uncircumcision"" are also used to denote impurity or wickedness
   generally, and ""to circumcise the heart"" was to become tractable and
   docile. Ex 6:12, 1 Kgs 20:30; Jer 4:4; Jer 6:10; Jer 9:26; Eze 44:7;
   Acts 7:51. Jews who renounced Judaism sometimes endeavored to erase the
   mark of circumcision by a surgical operation, and probably Paul alludes
   to this. 1 Cor 7:18. See Covenant, Concision.","",1
1007,Cistern,"CIS'TERN . The face of the country and the rarity of rain between May
   and September made cisterns indispensable in Judgea. They were mostly
   private property. Num 21:22. Some were formed by merely excavating the
   earth; others were covered reservoirs, into which the water was
   conducted; and others still were lined with wood or cement, or hewn out
   of the rock with great labor and ornamented with much skill. When the
   pits were empty there was a tenacious mire at the bottom, and they were
   used as the places of the most cruel punishments. It was into such a
   pit, probably, that Joseph and Jeremiah were cast. Gen 37:22; Jer 38:6.
   Large cisterns are now found in Palestine at intervals of 15 or 20
   miles. One of them is described by a modern traveller to be 660 feet
   long by 270 broad. These cisterns were the chief dependence of the
   people for water; hence the force of the allusion. Jer 2:13. The city
   of Jerusalem was remarkably well supplied with water, so that during
   her many sieges her inhabitants never suffered from thirst. See
   Conduit.

   Various illustrations from the cistern are given in Scripture. A wheel
   was used to draw up the bucket, and ""the wheel broken at the cistern,""
   in Eccl 12:6, denotes the breaking up of the vital powers of the human
   body. An exhortation to due restraint in pleasure is indicated by
   ""Drink waters out of thine own cistern."" Prov 5:15.","",1
1008,Citizenship,"CIT'IZENSHIP . The Jew had no earthly citizenship in the Roman sense;
   his commonwealth was a congregation of believers, governed by the Lord
   himself. But Roman citizenship is referred to in the N.T. This was the
   term for the privileges enjoyed by certain subjects of the Roman
   empire. The right was obtained by inheritance or by purchase, Acts
   22:28, or by military service, by favor, or by manumission. Among the
   privileges of this position was, the possessor could not be imprisoned
   without trial. Acts 22:29, still less be scourged, Acts 16:37, or
   crucified. Since to inflict either of these was a great indignity and
   severely punished, the assertion that one was a Roman citizen was a
   deterrent. But Jews who escaped on this account were still liable to
   their own law. 2 Cor 11:24. The right of appeal unto Caesar was one of
   the privileges of Roman citizenship. Acts 25:11. Paul was a Roman
   citizen, and repeatedly availed himself of his privileges against the
   violence of the mob. The words ""I am a Roman citizen"" had a magic power
   all over the civilized world, and even among barbarians.","",1
1009,City,"CIT'Y . It is not very easy to determine by what the Jews distinguished
   villages from towns, and towns from cities. Probably, at first, a
   number of tents and cottages formed a village. They were brought
   together by family relationship, by local attraction, and for mutual
   defence against more powerful clans or tribes. When their situation
   became insecure, they began to protect themselves by a ditch or hedge
   or a wall. The advancement from this rude state to the fortified towns
   and cities of ancient days was easy and rapid. The first city was built
   by Cain. Gen 4:17. It may be presumed that cities were always walled.
   Num 13:28. They were often (if not always) fortified, and many of them
   were very populous. The streets were crooked and narrow, so that in
   some of them loaded camels could not pass each other, as is the case
   to-day in Alexandria, Cairo, Jerusalem, and Damascus. Sometimes, in
   Asiatic cities, a broad street, or a section of it, is covered for the
   accommodation of merchants or tradesmen, and such places are called
   bazaars; and the prominent branch of business transacted there gives
   the name to the street; as, the woollen-drapers', coppersmiths', etc.
   Around the gates of cities was the principal concourse of people, Neh
   8:1; Job 29:7; and therefore these stations were desirable for booths
   or stalls for the sale of merchandise. 2 Kgs 7:1. These square or open
   places are probably intended in 2 Chr 32:6 and Neh 3:16; Neh 8:1, Num
   1:3. Some cities were adorned with open squares and large gardens.
   One-third of the city of Babylon was occupied with gardens. Csesarea,
   Jerusalem, Antioch, and other of the largest cities, were paved.

   Fenced City, 2 Kgs 10:2, or Defenced Cities, Isa 36:1, a fortified
   city. To build a city and to fortify or fence it, in the Oriental
   idiom, mean the same thing. The fencing or fortification was usually
   with high walls, and watch-towers upon them. Deut 3:5. The walls of
   fortified cities were formed, in part at least, of combustible
   materials, Am 1:7, 1 Kgs 16:10, 2 Kgs 22:14, the gates being covered
   with thick plates of iron or brass, Ps 107:16; Isa 45:2; Acts 12:10.
   There was also within the city a citadel or tower, to which the
   inhabitants fled when the city itself could not be defended. Jud
   9:46-52. These were often upon elevated ground, and were entered by a
   flight of steps. See Gate.

   At the time when Abraham came into the land of Canaan there were
   already in existence numerous towns, which are mentioned in the book of
   Genesis -Sodom, Gomorrah, Zeboim, Admah, Bela, Hebron, and Damascus.
   This last is probably the oldest city in the world. The spies who were
   sent to Canaan brought back an account of well fortified cities. In the
   book of Joshua we read of no less than 600 towns of which the
   Israelites took possession. When the city of Ai was taken, its
   inhabitants, who were put to the sword, amounted to 12,000, Josh
   8:16-25, and we are told that Gibeon was a still greater city. Josh
   10:2. It is commonly calculated that in Europe one-third or one-fourth
   of a nation is comprised in its cities and towns. Reckoning the
   Hebrews, then, at 3,000,000, it would give about 1250 for the average
   population of the towns, and it is probable that half the inhabitants
   dwelt in towns for greater safety. Now, in Gibeah, Jud 20:15, there
   were 700 men who bore arms, and of course not less than 3000
   inhabitants. By a similar calculation, we conclude that the 48 cities
   of the Levites contained each about 1000 souls. In the time of David
   the population of Palestine was between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000, and we
   may suppose that the towns and cities were proportionately increased.
   On the great annual festivals Jerusalem presented a sublime spectacle
   of countless multitudes, when all the males of the nation were required
   to be there assembled. At such times the city itself was insufficient
   to contain the host of Israel, and thousands encamped around on its
   outskirts. After the return from the Babylonish captivity, the
   population of the towns may have been inconsiderable, but the
   subsequent increase was most rapid; so that in the time of Josephus the
   small villages of Galilee contained 15,000 inhabitants, and the larger
   towns 50,000. At the same period Jerusalem was 4 miles in circuit and
   had a population of 150,000.

   The same author tells us that under Cestius the number of paschal lambs
   was 256,500, which would give about 2,700,000 persons attending the
   Passover. At the time of the fatal siege of Jerusalem more than
   1,000,000 of persons were shut in by the Romans; so that the space
   included by the 4 miles must have been remarkably economized. But the
   number may be exaggerated.

   City of David, 1 Chr 11:5, a section in the southern part of Jerusalem,
   embracing Mount Zion, where a fortress of the Jebusites stood. David
   reduced the fortress and built a new palace and city, to which he gave
   his own name. Bethlehem, the native town of David, is also called, from
   that circumstance, the city of David. Luke 2:11.

   City of God, Ps 46:4, was one of the names of ancient Jerusalem, and
   its appropriateness is evident from Deut 12:5.

   Holy City. Neh 11:1. The sacredness of the temple extended itself in
   some measure over the city, and hence Jerusalem itself was called the
   ""Holy City,"" and is so distinguished in the East at the present day.

   Cities of the Plain. See Sodom.

   Cities of Refuge, Deut 19:7, Gal 1:9; Josh 20:2, Josh 20:7-8, were six
   of the Levitical cities divinely appointed by the Jewish law as
   asylums, to which those who had been undesignedly accessory to the
   death of a fellow-creature were commanded to flee for safety and
   protection. The kinsmen of the deceased, or other persons who might
   pursue to kill him, could not molest him in one of these cities until
   his offence was investigated and the judgment of the congregation
   passed. If he were not within the provisions of the law, he was
   delivered to the avenger and slain. If he was, then his life was safe
   so long as he lived within the city or in the circuit of 1000 yards
   beyond. There he must remain until the death of the high priest during
   whose term of office the homicide was committed. The custom of
   blood-revenge was deeply rooted among the Israelites, and continues
   among the Arabs to this day, and the institution of cities of refuge
   was wisely designed to check the violence of human passion. Several
   sections of the Jewish law have relation to this subject. For the size
   and situation of the cities, see Num 35:4-5, 2 Kgs 22:14; the
   description of persons and the manner of killing in cases which
   entitled the slayer to protection, Num 35:15-25; Deut 19:4-13. For the
   mode of ascertaining whether the offence was worthy of death and the
   consequences of the judgment, see Num 35:24-33; and for the rules to be
   observed by the manslayer in order to avail himself of the benefit of
   the city of refuge, see Num 35:25-28. It is doubtful whether the trial
   of the manslayer was had at the city of refuge or in the vicinity of
   the place where the offence occurred. Perhaps there were two processes,
   one introductory to the other, as we have a preliminary examination to
   determine if the party accused shall be held to answer for his offence.
   This first process might have been at the city of refuge. Jewish
   writers say that signs were erected in some conspicuous place, pointing
   to the cities of refuge, at every crossroad, on which was inscribed,
   ""Refuge, Refuge,"" which, with many other similar provisions, were
   designed to direct and facilitate the flight of the unhappy man who was
   pursued by the avenger of blood. There were other sacred places of
   refuge, particularly the temple and the altar of burnt-offerings. Ex
   21:14.

   in the streets, Ps 18:42; at the bottom of the sea, Isa 57:20; in a
   cistern or subterranean prison. Jer 38:6. It is also translated ""clay""
   -i.e. potter's clay- Isa 41:25; Nah 3:14. In the N.T. the word ""clay""
   is applied to a mixture of spittle with dust. John 9:6, Rev 1:11, 2 Sam
   20:15. For the use of clay in brickmaking, see Brick; and in pottery,
   see Potter. Clay was also used for sealing. Job 38:14. Wine-jars,

1015,Clean,"CLEAN, and UNCLEAN'. Lev 10:10. These words are applied in the Jewish
   law to persons, animals, and things.

   In order to partake of the privileges of the Jewish Church, the
   individual must not only be circumcised, but be ceremonially clean. How
   the various kinds of uncleanness were contracted, what time it
   continued, and what was the process of purification, are particularly
   described in Lev 11-15; Num 19.

   The division of animals into clean and unclean existed before the
   Flood, Gen 7:2, and was probably founded upon the practice of animal
   sacrifice. Those animals only which divide the hoof and chew the cud
   were regarded as clean. Lev 11:3-4. The same chapter enumerates a
   variety of beasts, birds, reptiles, fishes, and things which are
   unclean. See also Ex 22:31; Ex 34:15, Acts 11:26; Deut 14:21. One
   object of these distinctions was to guard the Jews against heathen
   idolatry. Eating with the Gentiles was regarded as a peculiar
   aggravation of the offence of associating with them. Matt 9:11; Acts
   11:3. Some of the prohibited animals were unwholesome. The Hebrews were
   taught by these strict regulations to habitually regard their relation
   to God, and to abstain from everything that should offend his infinite
   holiness or involve the least appearance of pollution. The distinction
   between clean and unclean animals and nations was annulled by a special
   revelation to Peter. Acts 10:9-16.","",1

1022,Cloth,"CLOTH . The art of making cloth was known very early. The skins of
   animals supplied the place of cloth at first, but we may suppose that
   spinning and needle-work were so far perfected as to furnish cloth, of
   a coarse kind at least, at an early period. Ex 35:25; Jud 5:30. The
   beauty of dress consisted in the fineness and color of the cloth. See
   Sackcloth.","",1
1023,Clothes,"CLOTHES, CLOTH'ING . The immobility of the East is evinced in nothing
   more than in the absence of any change in dress from generation to
   generation. The clothing of the ancient Hebrews may be known from that
   of the modern Orientals. The ordinary dress consisted of the inner
   garment, the outer garment, a girdle, and sandals.
    1. The inner garment originally was a sort of shirt, sleeveless, and
       reaching only to the knees. Afterward it was larger and longer, and
       with sleeves. A girdle confined it around the waist. Jud 14:13. A
       person with only it on was said to be naked. 1 Sam 19:24; Isa
       20:2-4; John 21:7. Its material was wool, cotton, or linen, varying
       in quality according to the taste and wealth of the owner. This
       inner garment is commonly translated in the Bible ""coat,"" but
       ""shirt"" would be more correct.
    2. The girdle. -When the garments came to be made long and flowing
       they were confined around the loins with girdles, which served not
       only to bind

   A Modern Arab. A Modern Greek.

   them to the body, but also to hold them when tucked up. This increased
   the gracefulness of their appearance and prevented them from
   interfering with labor or motion. Hence ""to gird up the loins"" became a
   significant figurative expression, denoting readiness for service,
   activity, and watchfulness, and ""to loose the girdle"" was to give way
   to repose and indolence. 2 Kgs 4:29; Job 38:3; Isa 5:27; Jer 1:17; Luke
   12:35; John 21:7; Acts 12:8; 1 Pet 1:13. This girdle was a belt or band
   of cord, cloth, or leather, 6 inches or more in breadth, with a clasp
   affixed to loosen or draw it closer. Sometimes the girdle was made of
   linen, Eze 16:10, and was often adorned with rich and beautiful
   ornaments of metal, precious stones, and embroidery.

   The girdle was used to carry weapons, 2 Sam 20:8, money, and other
   things usually carried by us in the pocket. The Arabs carry their
   daggers in it, pointing to the right side, and through all the East it
   is the place for the handkerchief, smoking-materials, and the
   implements of one's profession. See INK HORN. The word translated
   ""purses,"" Matt 10:9, is in other places translated ""girdle."" The girdle
   not only protected the body, but braced it with strength and firmness.
   The girdle is supposed by some to have been a chief article or
   appendage of the armor; hence to have it continually fastened upon the
   person is emblematical of great fidelity and vigilance. And because it
   encircled the body very closely, the

   Girded for Walking.

   perfect adherence of the people of God to his service is figuratively
   illustrated by the cleaving of the girdle to a man's loins. Jer 13:11.
   In the same view, righteousness and faithfulness are called by the
   prophet, Isa 11:6, ""the girdle"" of the promised Messiah.
    1. The outer or upper garment, Matt 21:8, or cloak, Matt 5:40, was a
       square or oblong strip of cloth, 2 or 3 yards long and 2 yards
       wide. Such a garment is now worn by the Arabs. It was simply
       wrapped around the body as a protection from the weather; and when
       occasion required, it might be thrown over the shoulder and under
       the arm, somewhat like an Indian blanket, and be fastened with
       clasps or buckles, two corners being in front, which were called
       skirts, and were often used as aprons sometimes are among us. Ex
       12:34; 2 Kgs 4:29; Luke 6:38. The Arabs throw this garment over the
       left shoulder and under the right arm, and thus cover the whole
       body, leaving only the right arm exposed. This garment was the poor
       man's bed-clothing. Ex 22:26-27; Job 22:6; Job 24:7. This was
       probably the cloak and the coat or linen garment to which reference
       is had in Matt 5:40, and, in a more ample form, was called a robe,
       Luke 23:11, or a mantle. 2 Kgs 2:8. It is supposed that the
       fringes, with the blue ribbon. Num 15:38, were placed on the
       corners or borders of this garment. Matt 23:5. They are seen still
       on ancient monuments.

   In winter fur dresses or skins were worn, as at the present day, in
   Eastern countries. A dress of sheep- or goatskins is, perhaps, meant in
   2 Kgs 1:8 and Zech 13:4. The common skins of this kind were worn by the
   poorest and meanest people, Heb 11:37, but the fur dresses were
   sometimes very costly, and constituted a part of the royal apparel. The
   word translated ""robe,"" Jon 3:6, is supposed to mean a fur garment. The
   sheep's clothing, Matt 7:15, was considered emblematical of innocence
   and gentleness, and was the disguise of the false prophets, who were,
   in truth, fierce and ravenous as wolves for the blood of souls. The
   word translated ""sheets,"" Jud 14:12-13, is supposed to denote some kind
   of garment worn next to the skin, and probably the same which is spoken
   of under the general name of ""fine linen"" in Prov 31:24; Isa 3:23; and
   Mark 15:46. See Sheets.

   The linen cloth mentioned in Mark 14:51 was probably an article of
   bedclothing caught up in haste and thrown around the body -""a wrapper
   of fine linen, which might be used in various ways, but especially as a
   night-shirt."" The Arabs use for a complete dress by day the same
   garment which serves them for a bed and covering by night. Deut 24:13.
   Such also is the use of the Highlander's plaid.

   The dress of the women differed from the men's only in the outer
   garments. A veil further distinguished them. It was considered a token
   of modesty in unmarried women. Gen 24:65, and of subjection and
   reverence in those that were married. 1 Cor 11:3-10. The robe was often
   made full, and when tucked up the front of it would answer the purpose
   of a large apron, which is one meaning of the word translated ""veil.""
   Ruth 3:15. The Arabs put their hykes or cloaks to a like use.

   Handkerchiefs. Acts 19:12. -These were common among the Hebrews. The
   people of Eastern nations at this day carry them in their hands, and
   they are often wrought beautifully with the needle.

   Aprons, mentioned in Acts 19:12, were sweat-cloths from the apostle's
   body.
    1. Sandals and shoes. Deut 25:9; Mark 6:9. -The sandal was at first a
       flat piece of wood or leather suited to the sole of the foot, and
       bound upon it by straps or strings. The fastening was called a
       latchet. Gen 14:23.

   The common sandal is made of a piece of hide from the neck of a camel,
   and sometimes of several thicknesses sewed together. It is fastened by
   two straps, one of which passes between the great and second toe, and
   the other around the heel and over the instep. Hence it appears that
   the shoe was easily slipped off, and that it afforded no protection
   from the dust and dirt. Sandals were never worn in the house. The
   taking off of the shoes was a mark of reverence shown to exalted
   persons and sacred places. At the doors of Hindoo pagodas and
   Mohammedan mosques sandals are collected in great numbers for the use
   of strangers.

   The necessity of washing the feet after every walk is obvious, and it
   was the first token of hospitality to supply water for this purpose.
   Gen 24:32; Luke 7:44. To unloose the straps or latchets was the
   business of a menial, Mark 1:7, as was also the washing of the feet.
   John 13:1-16.

   The wooden sandal is much worn in Arabia, Judaea, and Egypt. Though
   often expensive and neat, it was usually a cheap, coarse, and very
   clumsy article. The following represent various forms of sandals which
   are still in common use in many countries of the East.

   Sandals. (From Farrar's ""Life of Christ."")

   Mitre, Ex 39:28, or bonnet, Ex 28:40, was a part of the sacred dress
   only, worn on the head. The Arab women wear a cap of folded cloth not
   unlike the modern turban, and the Hebrew women wore head-dresses of
   various shapes. Isa 3:20.

   Blue fringes were attached to the four corners of the outer garment to
   remind the wearer of God's commandments. Num 15:37-39. It was one of
   the fringes of Jesus's garment which is called the ""hem"" touched by the
   woman. Matt 9:20; Luke 8:44. For enlarging these fringes to attract
   notice Jesus rebukes the Pharisees. Matt 23:5.

   Change of raiment or garments. 2 Kgs 5:5, Josh 11:22. -It is customary
   in the East at this day to make presents of garments; and the Asiatic
   princes keep changes of raiment ready made for presents to persons of
   distinction whom they wish particularly to honor. The simple and
   uniform shape of the garments makes this custom practicable, and
   accounts also for the change of one person's dress for another's which
   is mentioned in sacred history. Gen 27:15; 1 Sam 18:4. See also Deut
   22:5; Luke 15:22.

   Changeable suits of apparel, or festal robes, Isa 3:22, are supposed to
   have been made of some thin fabric ornamented with embroidery and worn
   over garments of various colors; of which beautiful representations are
   to be seen in Indian paintings.

   Coat of many colors. -This was, properly speaking, a ""shirt of
   extremities"" --a ""shirt"" which reached to the feet -probably made of
   fine material. Gen 37:3.

   Among the appendages to Jewish dress were jewels of gold and silver,
   bracelets, necklaces, ear-rings, etc. Nose- and ear-rings are very
   common in the East. The thread, Gen 14:23, is supposed by some to mean
   the thread

   Eastern Fringed Garment. (From Fanar's ""Life of Christ."")

   Bracelets were worn on the arms by both sexes, 2 Sam 1:10, and by
   females upon the leg also. Isa 3:19-20. See Bracelets. Women in Persia
   and Arabia wear rings full of little bells about the ankle. Isa 3:16.
   Hand-mirrors, made of molten brass and finely polished, were also a
   common accompaniment of female dress, Ex 38:8; Isa 3:23;, and were
   either carried in the hand or suspended from the girdle or neck. In
   later times these mirrors were made of polished steel.

   All the Grecian and Roman women, without distinction, wore their hair
   long. On this they lavished all their art, disposing it in various
   forms and embellishing it with many ornaments. In ancient medals and
   statues we see the plaited tresses interwoven with expensive and
   fantastic decorations so pointedly condemned by the apostle as proofs
   of a vain mind, and as inconsistent with the modesty and decorum of
   Christian women. 1 Tim 2:9-10; 1 Pet 3:1, 1 Pet 3:3-4. See
   Phylacteries.

   ""covering"" for the sky a ""darkness,"" or simply a ""vapor."" The
   references to clouds in the Bible will be better understood when the
   fact is known that from the beginning of May to the end of September
   not a cloud is usually seen, 1 Sam 12:17-18; hence their appearance
   would be phenomenal. The oncoming of clouds marked the approach of
   rain. 1 Kgs 18:44; Luke 12:54. ""A cloud without rain"" was indeed a
   proverb for a man whose performance belied his promise. Prov 25:14.
   Clouds shield the divine Presence, Ex 16:10; Ex 33:9; Num 11:25; 1 Kgs
   8:10; Job 22:14; Ps 18:11; and in evidence of the divinity of Christ is
   the fact that clouds play a part in his recorded life and in his future
   glory. Matt 17:5; Matt 24:30; Acts 1:9; Rev 14:14. Clouds symbolize
   transitoriness. Job 30:15; Hos 6:4; armies and multitudes of people,

   signifies a creature that hisses, doubtless some species of serpent.
   Tristram proposes the great yellow viper, the largest of its kind found
   in Palestine, and one of the most dangerous. On one occasion he saw one
   of these vipers spring on a quail which was feeding; ""It missed its
   prey, and the bird fluttered on a few yards, and then fell in the
   agonies of death. On taking it up I found that the viper had made the
   slightest possible puncture in the flesh of one of the wings as it
   snapped at it, and this had caused death in the course of a few
   seconds."" In the passage from Jeremiah above cited allusion is made to

   their manifold and aggravated sins.
","",1
1034,Cock-crowing,"COCK'-CROWING. Mark 13:35. A name given to the third watch of the
   night, from midnight to daybreak. Some perplexity has been occasioned
   by the difference between the expressions in Matt 26:34, ""before the
   cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice,"" and Mark 14:30, ""before the cock
   crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice."" To reconcile this seeming
   variance, it is stated that there were two cock-crowings -one soon
   after midnight, and the other about three o'clock- and that the last,
   which was the signal of approaching day, was spoken of as the
   cock-crowing. To this it has been answered that only one hour elapsed
   between the denials. Luke 22:59. This is true of the second and third,
   but there seems to be no authority for saying it is of the first and
   second. It seems most natural to suppose that the phraseology in both
   cases was substantially the same, and that the Jews understood by the
   phrase ""before the cock crow"" the same time which was denoted by the
   phrase ""before the cock crow twice."" Both referred to that cock-crowing
   which especially and most distinctly marked a watch or division of the
   night. There is no reference to poultry in the O.T., and only an
   incidental one in the New. Matt 23:37; Luke 13:34. Some suppose that
   poultry were introduced into Judaea by the Romans.","",1

1044,Colors,"COL'ORS . Gen 37:3. The art of coloring cloth seems to have attained to
   great perfection among the Jews, though it did not originate with them,
   but with their idolatrous neighbors, the Phoenicians and Egyptians, the
   former supplying the dyes, the latter the mode of applying them. Four
   artificial colors are spoken of in the Bible.
    1. Purple, which was derived from a shell-fish native to the
       Mediterranean

   Sea. The coloring-matter was found in a small vessel in the fish, and
   the rest of the fish was useless. Purple was the royal and noble color,
   indicative of wealth and station. Jud 8:26; Esth 8:15; Luke 16:19; Rev
   17:4.
    1. Blue, produced from a similar source, used in the same way, and for
       the same purposes. Ex 25:4; Esth 1:6.
    2. Scarlet, and crimson appear to express the same color. ""The dye was
       produced from an insect somewhat resembling the cochineal, which is
       found in considerable quantities in Armenia and other Eastern
       countries"" -Smith. The three colors above mentioned, together with
       white, were employed in the tabernacle curtains and in the
       vestments of the priests.
    3. Vermilion was used in fresco-painting, Eze 23:14, for coloring the
       idols themselves, and for decorating the walls; and beams of
       houses. Jer 22:14.

   The natural colors noticed in the Bible are white, black, red, yellow,
   and green, yet only three colors are sharply defined, white, black, and
   red. To show the vagueness of the use of the others, the tint green
   (translated ""yellow"" in the A.V.) is applied in the Hebrew to gold, Ps
   68:13, and to the leprous spot. Lev 13:49.","",1

   Col 1:2, and possibly visited it on his third missionary journey. See
   Acts 18:23; Acts 19:10. The town is now in ruins; there is a little
   village called Chronos 3 miles south of the site of Colosse.","",1
1046,Colossians,"COLOSSIANS, EPIS'TLE TO THE, was written by Paul while he was a
   prisoner at Rome, a.d. 62. It is probable that Epaphras, who is spoken
   of as the minister of Christ in that place. Col 1:7, came to Rome to
   consult Paul respecting the semi-Judaistic and semi-Oriental opinions
   that had been preached among the Colossians by Jews who had been
   tainted by Essenic Gnosticism. See Essenes. These notions would tend
   not only to mar the simplicity of their belief, but to obscure the
   glory of Christ. Col 2:8-23. To these damaging errors Paul writes a
   refutation. ""The occasion, then, of the Epistle being the existence and
   influence of false teachers in the Colossian church, the object of the
   apostle was to set before them their real standing in Christ, the
   majesty of his person, and the completeness of his redemption, and to
   exhort them to conformity with their risen Lord, following this out
   into all subordinate duties and occasions of common life.""

   similar to it, but more full on the doctrine of the church. Both were
   sent from Rome by the same bearers, Tychicus and Onesimus.","",1

   formed separate communities, and when the dwellers in cities became
   dependent upon farmers and foreign nations for food. We find notices of
   trade in this way in the time of Abraham, and particularly in the
   history of Joseph and of the Egyptian famine. But foreign trade was not
   much cultivated by the Jews. Indeed, they do not seem to have been in
   the least a sea-faring people, for the commercial enterprises of
   Solomon and of Jehoshaphat both ultimately failed. 1 Kgs 22:48-49. But
   we know that the Jews consumed foreign articles, Neh 13:16; Ezr 3:7,
   and also supplied foreign countries, as Phoenicia. 1 Kgs 5:11; Eze
   27:17; Acts 12:20. Joppa, the modern Jaffa, the port of Jerusalem,
   carried on a busy trade. From it went vessels to various ports. Isa
   2:16; Jon 1:3. The internal trade was largely increased by the

   They thus perverted the rite, and therefore, instead of calling them by
   the honorable name of the ""circumcision,"" Paul calls them the
   ""concision,"" the ""mutilation.""","",1
1056,Concubine,"CON'CUBINE, by the Jewish law, a lawful wife of a secondary or inferior
   rank, and consequently neither regarded nor treated as the matron or
   mistress of the house. Concubines were either Hebrew girls bought of
   their fathers, or Gentile captives taken in war. Foreign slaves or
   Canaanitish women were also illegally concubines. Concubines were not
   betrothed or wedded with the usual solemnities and ceremonies which
   attended marriage. They had no share in the family government, and the
   children of the wife were preferred to the child of the concubine in
   the distribution of the inheritance. Yet the children of the latter
   were not counted as illegitimate, but stood upon the same footing as
   those of the wife in the family, as their names occur in the
   genealogical lists. Gen 22:24; 1 Chr 1:32. The custom among the Jews
   originated in the great desire for children, and therefore it was that
   barren wives gave their maid-servants to their husbands that they might
   have children by them. Gen 16:3; Gen 30:4. The law of Moses did not
   stop the practice, but modified it. Ex 21:7-9;Deut 21:10-17. There was
   no stigma upon the position. The concubine was a recognized member of
   the family; when she had been a slave previous to becoming such a one,
   she still remained in slavery. Her distinction from the wife was in her
   lower social position, and in her far looser hold upon her husband. She
   might be dismissed without any formal divorce. Her unfaithfulness was
   criminal, but not looked at as, strictly speaking, adultery, and hence
   was not so severely punished. Jud 19:2. In the days of the monarchy the
   kings imitated their heathen neighbors in the establishment of harems,
   and multiplied the number of wives and concubines. To seize on the
   royal concubines for his own use was thus a usurper's first act. Such
   was probably the intent of Abner's act, 2 Sam 3:7, and similarly the
   request on behalf of Adonijah was construed. 1 Kgs 2:21-24. -Smith:
   Dictionary of the Bible.

   Where polygamy was tolerated -as it was among the Jews- the permission
   of concubinage would not seem so much at war with the interests and
   preservation of society as we know it to be. The gospel restores the
   sacred institution of marriage to its original character, Gen 2:24;
   Matt 19:5; 1 Cor 7:2, and concubinage is ranked with fornication and
   adultery.","",1
1057,Condemation,"CONDEMA'TION. The term refers to the sentence pronounced upon an
   adjudged criminal. In the sight of God the race lies under condemnation
   because of Adam's inherited sin and their actual transgressions. Rom
   5:16, 1 Sam 30:18. The law which convicts men of sin is called the
   ""ministration of condemnation."" 2 Cor 3:7, Gal 1:9. But the gospel
   announces deliverance from sin. John 3:18. Therefore it is truly ""good
   tidings of great joy."" Luke 2:10. By faith in Christ are we delivered
   from condemnation, and are brought into the glorious liberty of the
   children of God. Rom 8:21.","",1
1058,Conduit,"CON'DUIT (te'alah in Hebrew). 2 Kgs 18:17; 2 Kgs 20:20; Isa 7:3; Isa
   36:2. Used to signify something for conveying water, as a
   ""water-course,"" Job 38:25, or a ""trench."" It probably included an
   aqueduct, such as must have been used to convey the water from the Pool
   of Solomon to Jerusalem. Pilate built a new aqueduct or repaired that
   of Solomon, which still remains.","",1
1059,Coney,"CO'NEY (the hider), a small animal (Hyrux Syriacus) found in Syria and
   Arabia, and much resembling the rabbit in size, general appearance, and
   habits. Ps 104:18 ,-Prov 30:26. Its Hebrew name is appropriate, from
   its dwelling in the rocks. The coney, however, does not burrow, but,
   like the rhinoceros and hippopotamus (with which naturalists class it),
   has hoofs rather than nails upon its toes. It is almost tailless, has
   short ears, is clothed in tawny fur, and is a very timid and harmless
   creature.

   Solomon justly pronounced the coneys ""exceeding wise."" So great is
   their wariness that they have never been trapped and can but rarely be
   shot. They are accustomed to feed in small companies upon the herbage
   near their fastnesses, but it is said they always first post a
   sentinel, and at a squeak of alarm, on the least indication of danger,
   they all plunge into their retreats. The references to this animal in
   the

   Coney. (Hyrax Syriacus. After Houghton.)

   Law (Lev 11:5; Deut 14:7) are to be understood in a popular sense.
   Though not strictly a ruminant animal, the coney, like the hare and
   rabbit, has a habit of moving its jaws as if chewing, while it does not
   completely divide the hoof, as does the ox or deer.

   The coney ""is an exceedingly active creature, leaping from rock to rock
   with wonderful rapidity, its little sharp hoofs giving it a firm hold
   of the hard and irregular surface of the stony ground. Even in
   captivity it retains much of its activity, and flies about its cage
   with a rapidity that seems more suitable to a squirrel than to an
   animal allied to the rhinoceros and hippopotamus. ... It is a tolerably
   prolific animal, rearing four or five young at a birth, and keeping
   them in a soft bed of hay and fur, in which they are almost hidden. If
   surprised in its hole and seized, the Hyrnx will bite very sharply, its
   long, chisel-edged teeth inflicting severe wounds on the hand that
   attempts to grasp it. But it is of a tolerably docile disposition, and
   in a short time learns to know its owner, and to delight in receiving
   his caresses."" J.G. Wood.","",1
1060,Congregation,"CONGREGA'TION, an assembly; a gathering of people for either political

    1. In the O.T. (kabal) it denotes the Hebrew people in its collective
       capacity, under its peculiar aspect as a holy community, held
       together by religious rather than political bonds. Deut 31:30; Josh
       8:35; 1 Chr 29:1, etc. ""Sometimes it is used in a broad sense, as
       inclusive of foreign settlers, Ex 12:19, but more properly as
       exclusively appropriate to the Hebrew element of the population.
       Num 15:15."" The congregation was governed by the chief of the
       tribes and families, but from these was selected a council of 70
       elders. Num 16:2; Num 11:16. This was a permanent institution, for
       these representatives of the people -who at first met at the door
       of the tabernacle at the call of one silver trumpet, while the
       congregation came at sound of the two, Num 10:3-4, 1 Kgs 15:7-
       became in postexilic days the Sanhedrin. Doubtless these meetings
       of the elders are often meant when the term ""congregation"" is used.
       Thus they meet to elect a king. 1 Sam 10:17. Their decisions bound
       the nation. Josh 9:15, 1 Sam 30:18.
    2. In the N.T. it means the Christian Church at large or a local
       congregation, but in King James's Version the corresponding Greek
       word (ecelesia), when used of a religious assembly, is always
       rendered ""church,"" even in Acts 7:38, where it means the Jewish
       congregation in the wilderness. King James expressly commanded the
       revisers to do this, in opposition to the Geneva Version, which
       uses the more literal rendering ""congregation."" In Acts 19:32, Acts

   accordingly. Rom 2:15. This universal tribunal is established in the
   breast of every man, even the heathen. It may be weakened, perverted,
   stupefied, defiled, and hardened in various ways, and its decisions are

1066,Conversion,"CONVER'SION, or turning from one state, pursuit, inclination, or
   direction to another. Acts 15:3. The corresponding Greek term in the
   N.T. denotes a change of mind or heart which takes place in the sinner
   when the Holy Spirit convinces him of his sinfulness, persuades him to
   hate sin and to forsake it, and to lead a life of holy obedience to
   Christ. Matt 3:8; Luke 3:3; Luke 15:7; Luke 24:47; Acts 5:31; Acts
   11:18; Acts 20:21;2 Cor 7:9-10; 2 Tim 2:25; Heb 6:16; Heb 12:17; 2 Pet
   3:9. Conversion is an act of man, while regeneration, or the new birth,
   is an act of God, but both are produced by the agency of the Holy
   Spirit, and usually coincide, though not always; for very young
   children may be regenerated, but cannot, strictly speaking, be said to
   be converted. The Scriptures describe mankind as alienated from God, as
   having the understanding darkened, and as dead in trespasses and sins.
   Hence the corresponding force and pertinency of the terms by which the
   change is described; such as created, renewed, Eph 4:23-24, restored to

   9 miles distant, and Lechaion, on the west, only about 2 miles away.
   Corinth was about 5 miles in circuit, and on the south an immense rocky
   mountain called Aeroeorinthus rises abruptly to the height of 2000
   feet, upon the summit of which was a temple of Venus. It had an
   extensive commerce, like all the large towns on the Mediterranean Sea,
   and became celebrated for its wealth, magnificence, and learning. It
   was esteemed as the light and ornament of all Greece. It was, however,
   no less remarkable for its corruption and licentiousness. ""To live as

1079,Corinthians,"CORINTHIANS, PAUL'S EPISTLES TO THE. They exhibit the trials and
   temptations, the virtues and vices, of a Greek congregation in
   apostolic times, and the wisdom and love, the trials and patience, of
   Paul in dealing with some of the most difficult practical and doctrinal
   questions which arise again and again in the history of every church.
   They are so full of individuality and local adaptation that their
   Pauline origin has never been disputed.
    1. The First Epistle was written at Ephesus, toward the close of the
       apostle's three years' residence there, in the spring of a.d. 57.
       It was sent to the church by Stephanas, Fortunatus, Achaicus, and
       Timotheus, according to the superscription. Its immediate cause was
       the painful news which had reached Paul that there were dissensions
       in the church between the different elements -converted Jews,
       proselytes, and Gentiles- which composed it. Some of the members
       declared themselves Pauline, while others were Petrine; others were
       of Apollos, and others of Christ -Christians in a sectarian and
       exclusive sense, Rom 16:1-4. This state of things is explicable.
       The Corinthian church was founded by the apostle while upon his
       second missionary journey. Acts 18:1, sq., during his eighteen
       months' residence in Corinth. Not long after he left, Apollos came.
       Acts 19:1, who by his eloquence won followers. Judaizers also from
       Jerusalem came to the city, who misrepresented Paul as a dangerous
       radical, denied his apostolic authority, and obliged him to defend
       himself. Thus the church was sadly rent. Those who styled
       themselves ""of Christ"" may have at first attempted reconciliation
       by going back of all human authority to Christ, but would seem
       finally to have added a fourth to the existing factions. Another
       trouble which demanded decisive action was a lax state of sexual
       morals. This gives Paul opportunity to express his views upon
       marriage and the relation of the sexes generally, chs.Acts 19:5-7.
       From these specific cases of overt act he passes to the
       consideration of several matters of Christian practice -eating
       meats offered to idols, chs.Acts 19:8-9; the proper observance of
       the Lord's Supper and its true nature, ch.1 Kgs 16:10; the
       proprieties of worship, ch.Rev 1:11; the gifts of the Spirit, chs.
       Acts 19:12-14, In ch. 2 Sam 20:15 he treats of the resurrection in
       a strain of marvellous eloquence.
    2. The Second Epistle was written from Macedonia, Acts 7:5 Neh 8:1; 2
       Cor 9:2, in the same year, a few months later than the First- i.e.
       in the summer or autumn of A,D. 57. The contents seem to have been
       determined by the accounts the apostle had received from Titus, and
       perhaps, also, from Timothy, of the effect of his previous Epistle.
       This was upon the whole favorable; still, many denied Paul's right
       to the apostleship. Accordingly, in this Epistle he first of

   all gives an account of his ministry and opens his heart toward his
   converts, Acts 1-7; next, exhorts them to give liberally to the support
   of the church in Jerusalem, probably because this proof of Christian
   brotherhood would cure their local jealousies, chs. Acts 19:8-9; and
   lastly, he defends his apostolical character, chs. Acts 1:10-13.

   It has been generally supposed, from 1 Cor 5:9, that there were more
   epistles to this church than these two, but how many cannot be
   determined. The two Epistles are singularly affectionate, although this
   church was sadly removed from the ideal.","",1

   salt and fresh waters of Syria, and is certainly a ""plunger,"" so that
   there is no reason for a change in the passages of the Pentateuch, as
   some have suggested. These birds are as large as the raven, of a dark
   color, with long necks, webbed feet, feed upon fish, and are proverbial
   for their voracity. See cut on p. 203.","",1
1082,Corn,"CORN . Mark 4:28. This word is generally applied in the United States
   to maize or Indian-corn, which it never means in the Bible, for that
   grain, like the Western continent, was, in scriptural times, as yet
   undiscovered. The English Bible uses the word as the general name for
   all sorts of cereals, such as wheat, barley, millet, and fitches, and
   of such cornfields only must we think. Oats are not known in Palestine,
   and rye is rarely, if ever, grown.

   A ""corn of wheat"" is a kernel of wheat. The figurative use of the word
   ""corn,"" usually in connection with wine and oil, is very frequent, as
   grain and wine and olives were the leading productions of the country.
   Deut 11:14; Deut 18:4; Deut 28:51; 2 Chr 32:28; Hos 2:22; Joel 2:19.

   It is probable that grain was commonly used in its crude state in the
   early ages of the world. It was sometimes done in later times, Matt
   12:1; and even now it is no uncommon thing, in passing a field of
   wheat, to pluck an ear, and, after rubbing the husk or beard off by
   rolling it between the hands, to eat the grain, which is very
   palatable, even in that state. The Jewish law permitted standing corn
   to be plucked by any one passing through it, Deut 23:25; and this
   custom, or right, is still respected in some parts of the East. See
   Mills.

   The "" parched corn"" of the Bible, Lev 23:14; Ruth 2:14; 1 Sam 17:17,
   etc., corresponds to the kaly of the Arabs, and is obtained in the
   following manner: When wheat is being harvested, some of the green ears
   are thrown upon the coals of fire and roasted; they are but partially
   divested of the hull by rubbing between the hands, and are very much
   relished."" Van Lennep.","",1

   Gentile by birth, but a God-fearing man, a half proselyte i.e. leaning
   to the Jewish religion, yet uncircumcised, and hence considered
   unclean. Acts 10:1. His prayers, being offered in the faith of a
   promised Messiah, were heard, and God sent Peter to make known to him
   the plan of salvation through a crucified and risen Redeemer. Thus the
   door of faith was opened to the Gentiles. Cornelius and his family were
   baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Acts 10 and Rev 1:11.","",1
1084,Corner,"COR'NER . According to the Mosaic law, it was forbidden to reap the
   corners of the field, so that there might be gleanings for the poor.
   Lev 19:9; Jer 23:22. The ""corner of the house-top,"" Prov 21:9, is a
   narrow place exposed to sun and rain, contrasted with the wide room or
   house below. The word ""corner"" in the phrase ""corners of Moab,"" or of
   any other country. Num 24:17; Jer 48:45, means the length and breadth
   of the country, and also of the world. ""Corner of a bed,"" Am 3:12, the
   corner of a room, was on the elevated part (used by night for a bed or
   couch), and contained the most honorable seat. See Bed. In the passage
   last cited it figuratively denotes the most proud and luxurious of the
   Israelites in Samaria. In Zech 10:4 the word ""corner"" is used to denote
   either the corner-stone or the most conspicuous part of a building, and
   evidently refers to Christ, Matt 21:42, where he is mentioned as ""the
   head"" (or chief ) ""of the corner,"" though the Jews, in erecting the
   temple of their faith, rejected him as unfit for so important a place.

1096,Covenant,"COVENANT, an agreement or mutual obligation contracted deliberately and
   with solemnity. God's covenant with men signifies his solemn promise or
   engagement. Gen 17:14; Ex 34:10; Deut 4:13; Isa 59:21.

   The Hebrew word for ""making a covenant"" signifies ""a cutting,"" because
   covenants were often made by cutting animals in two and passing between
   their parts. Gen 15:10, 2 Sam 21:17; Jer 34:18.

   The term ""the covenants,"" Rom 9:4, refers to the various promises made
   to Abraham. God made a covenant with Noah and with Abraham.

   The chief and most important use of the word, however, is in relation
   to the two great dispensations which are distinguished as the old and
   new, or as the covenant of the law and the covenant of the gospel. The
   former was made with the children of Israel through Moses, and rested
   much in the outward ceremonies and observances which the law enjoined
   (meats and drinks, and divers washings and carnal ordinances). The new
   covenant was made through Christ, sealed by his own blood, and secures
   to every believer the blessings of salvation and eternal life. Comp. Ex
   20:24; Gal 3; Heb 8. The titles ""Old and New Testaments"" arose from the
   inaccurate rendering of the word ""covenant"" by testamentum in the Latin
   Vulgate.

   Covenant of Salt. Num 18:19; 2 Chr 13:5. This term denotes a covenant

   cannot lawfully possess, it is sinful and becomes covetousness, which
   is idolatry, Col 3:5, for it is placing the heart and affections on the
   creature rather than on the Creator. Covetousness has relation commonly
   to riches, and, in the scriptural sense, includes the desire of
   accumulating, whatever may be the means. Prov 28:16; Eccl 5:10; Luke

1105,Create,"CREATE', Ps 61:10, CREA'TOR, Eccl 12:1, CREA'TION. Mark 10:6. The word
   ""creation"" sometimes denotes all living things, and at others the act
   of creation. To create is to cause anything to exist that never existed
   in any form or manner before. Gen 1:1; Col 1:16. It is to make without
   materials to make of. Thus, ""God said, Let there be light, and there
   was light."" Gen 1:3.

   The panorama of creation in the first two chapters of Genesis is the
   sublimest that can be found or conceived, and eminently worthy of God,
   and man as made in the image of God. Neither poetry nor science has
   been able, or will ever be able, to produce anything better. God must
   have revealed it to the writer in a retrospective vision. The Bible
   gives two accounts. Gen 1:1-2:3, and Gen 2:4-25. They supplement each
   other, and they differ as the names of God Elohim (used in the first)
   and Jehovah (used in the second) differ. The first refers to the
   creation of the whole universe, the second looks particularly to the
   creation of man and to the subsequent history of the fall and of
   redemption. The great object of the inspired writer in both was to show
   that God is the Author of all existence, that he made all things in
   beautiful order, and that he made them for his glory and for the use
   and dominion of man as the crowning work of his hands; that the God who
   created the universe is the same as the Jehovah of the history of the
   redemption of fallen man. The six days represent six indescribable
   divine works in six divine periods, ending in a divine rest. Gen 2:2-3.

   The first work was the creation of light -i.e. the diffused cosmic
   light; the second, the organization of the physical heavens and the
   separation of the firmament from the earth; the third, the formation of
   the earth and the division of sea and land, with the creation of
   vegetable life; the fourth, the creation of the sun -i.e. the
   concentrated solar light-and the planetary system; the fifth, the
   creation of lower animal life in water and air; the sixth, the creation
   of higher animals on land, and the creation of man in the image of God.
   On the seventh day God rested from his creative work and entered upon
   his activity as the Preserver of all things, blessing his creatures and
   instituting the weekly day of rest for the benefit of body and soul.
   The first three days represent the era of matter, the next three days
   the era of life; the seventh day introduces the period of history, or
   of the moral world as distinct from the physical.

   The six days of creation are not necessarily six literal days, but may
   be, and are probably, periods of indefinite length. The question is not
   what God could do (for one hour or one minute would suffice for his
   omnipotence), but in what manner he usually works. That the word ""day""
   is often used in a wider sense is evident from such expressions as the
   ""day of the wicked,"" the ""day of grace,"" the ""day of judgment."" To God
   a thousand years are as one day. Ps 90:4; 2 Pet 3:8. The narrative
   itself indicates such a wider use of the word; for the sun, that
   luminary which determines the solar day, was not created before the
   fourth day, and the seventh day, which represents the period of divine
   rest or preservation, has no evening. Gen 2:4. For a profound scholarly
   handling of this matter see Tayler Lewis's, ""Special Introduction to
   the First Chapter of Genesis,"" part ii. pp. 131-135, in Lange's
   Commentary on Genesis (and his Six Days of Creation). He says: ""It is
   not any duration, but the phenomenon, the appearing itself, that is
   called day."" The Bible and science, nature and revelation, being the
   products of one and the same God, cannot contradict each other; and
   various attempts have been made to harmonize the Mosaic cosmogony with
   modern geology and astronomy by able Christian scientists (such as
   Prof. Guyot, Principal Dawson, and others). But it should be kept in
   mind that the Bible does not intend to teach science, but religion and
   the way of salvation. The great truths taught by Moses in the first two
   chapters of Genesis are obvious and independent of all science, as
   Guyot says: ""A personal God calling into existence by his free,
   almighty will, manifested by his word, executed by his Spirit, things
   which had no being; a Creator distinct from his creation; a universe,
   not eternal, but which had a beginning in time; a creation
   successive-the six days-and progressive-beginning with the lowest
   element, matter, continuing by the plant and animal life, terminating
   by man, made in God's image; thus marking the great steps through which
   God, in the course of ages, has gradually realized the vast organic
   plan of the cosmos we now behold in its completeness, and which he
   declared to be very good,-these are the fundamental spiritual truths
   which have enlightened men of all ages on the true relations of God to
   his creation and to man. To understand them fully, to be comforted by
   them, requires no astronomy or geology. To depart from them is to
   relapse into the cold, unintelligent fatalism of the old pantheistic
   religions and modern philosophies, or to fall from the uppper regions
   of light and love infinite into the dark abysses of an unavoidable
   scepticism.""

   It is interesting to compare with the Mosaic cosmogony the old Assyrian
   tradition of the Creation, which has been brought to light by modern
   discovery.

   These Chaldaean or Assyrian legends of the Creation have been
   discovered in a mutilated form, written upon twelve tablets, and are
   printed by the late Mr. George Smith in his Chaldaean Account of
   Genesis (London, 1876). He thus translates the fragments which contain
   the first part of the story: ""When above were not raised the heavens,
   and below on the earth a plant had not grown up; the abyss also had not
   broken up their boundaries: the chaos (or water) Tiamat (the sea) was
   the producing mother of the whole of them. Those waters at the
   beginning were ordained; but a tree had not grown, a flower had not
   unfolded. When the gods had not sprung up, any one of them; a plant had
   not grown, and order did not exist; were made also the great gods, the
   gods Lahmu and Lahamu they caused to come . . . and they grew . . . the
   gods Sar and Kisar were made ... a course of days and a long time
   passed"" (pp. 62, 63). Compare Gen 1:1-2.

   The succeeding tablets are so broken that no connected story can be
   read from them until we come to the fifth, which gives an account of
   the fourth day of creation: ""It was delightful, all that was fixed by
   the great gods. Stars, their appearance [in figures] of animals he
   arranged. To fix the year through the observation of their
   constellations, twelve months (or signs), of stars in three rows he
   arranged, from the day when the year commences unto the close. He
   marked the position of the wandering stars [planets] to shine in their
   courses, that they may not do injury, and may not trouble any one; the
   positions of the gods Bel and Hea he fixed with him. And he opened the
   great gates in the darkness shrouded-the fastenings were strong on the
   left and right. In its mass [i.e. the lower chaos] he made a boiling,
   the god Urn [the moon] he caused to rise out, the night he
   overshadowed, to fix it also for the light of the night, until the
   shining of the day, that the month might not be broken, and in its
   amount be regular. At the beginning of the month, at the rising of the
   night, his horns are breaking through to shine on the heaven. On the
   seventh day to a circle he begins to swell, and stretches toward the
   dawn further"" (pp. 69-71). Comp. Gen 1:14-19.

   The seventh tablet is very imperfect, but the translation gives some
   interesting coincidences with Genesis: ""When the gods in their assembly
   had created . . . were delightful the strong monsters . . . they caused
   to be living creatures . . . cattle of the field, beasts of the field,
   and creeping things of the field . . . they fixed for the living
   creatures . . . cattle and creeping things of the city they fixed . . .
   the assembly of the creeping things the whole which were created . . ,
   which in the assembly of my family . . . and the god Ninsi-ku (the lord
   of noble face) caused to be two . . . the assembly of the creeping
   things he caused to go ... "" (pp. 76,77). Comp. Gen 1:24-25.

   The tablets which relate the creation of man are unhappily so mutilated
   that the sense is totally uncertain, but the first fragment appears to
   give the speech of the Deity to the newly-created pair, and on the
   reverse a particular address to the woman. Then follow more tablets
   relating the Fall.

   Prof. Oppert read before the congress of Orientalists in Florence
   (1878) a translation of the Assyrian tablets relating to the Creation
   and the Fall, which differs greatly from the above-given translation of
   Mr. George Smith. The mutilated condition of the tablets, together with
   the uncertainty of many of the meanings, easily accounts for the
   differences. We give, by way of comparison, Prof. Oppert's translation
   of the tablet on which the fourth creative day is described:
    1. ""He distributed the stations of the great gods, seven in number,
    2. And fixed the stars, the mansions of the seven lumari (i.e. fixed
       stars regulating the celestial movements).
    3. He created the perpetual renewal of the year and divided it into
       thirty six decades.
    4. For each of the twelve months he fixed three stars.
    5. From the day of the beginning of the year until its close
    6. He fixed the station of the god Nibiru that their circles (of days)
       might be perpetually renewed.
    7. In order to prevent either shortening or interruption
    8. The stations of Bel and Hea he fixed with it,
    9. And he spread the three gates on the limbs of the angles.
   10. He made a sigar on the right and on the left:
   11. At the four exteriors he established staircases.
   12. The moon was appointed to betray the night,
   13. And he made it renew itself to hide the night and make day
       perpetual;
   14. (Saying): 'Every month with daybreak accomplish thy circle.
   15. In the beginning of the month the night will reign;
   16. Thy horns will be invisible, for the heaven is renewed.
   17. The seventh day thy disk will be filled up on the left,
   18. But open in darkness will remain the half on the right.
   19. (In the middle of the month) the sun will be on the horizon of the
       sky at thy rising.
   20. (In splendor may thy form reign and make . . .
   21. (Hence go back) and turn thyself toward the way of the sun.
   22. (Then will change) the darkness: to the sun return,
   23. . . . seek her ways . . .
   24. (Rise and) set according to the eternal laws.'""

   The account of the Creation upon these tablets is manifestly confused.
   How different the account in Genesis, which bears throughout the
   impress of truth! The Bible contains the revealed order of events; the
   tablets have only the traditional, and in part purely fanciful, story
   to tell.","",1

1113,Cross,"CROSS, CRUCIFY. Matt 23:34; Matt 27:32. Crucifixion is a mode of
   execution of great antiquity, and still prevails among the Hindoos and
   Chinese. It was regarded by the Romans as the basest and most
   ignominious death, deserved only by traitors and slaves. Luke 23:32. It
   was an accursed death. Deut 21:23; Gal 3:13. Hence the force of the
   expressions 1 Cor 1:23; Phil 2:8; Heb 12:2. As soon as the sentence was
   pronounced, ""Thou shalt be crucified,"" the person was stripped and
   fastened to a post about as high as the waist, and was then scourged
   with rods or whips made of leather strips armed with small bits of lead
   or bone, and often so severely as to occasion death. After the
   scourging the person was compelled to bear his own cross to the place
   of execution. This was usually an elevated place without the city, and
   near the highway.

   There are three forms of the cross-one in which the two pieces of wood
   cross below the top, one in which they are placed one on the top of the
   other, and one in which they are placed diagonally:

   Three Forms of the Cross.

   The first is the usual form; the second' is probably the oldest.

   The monogram of Christ used by the early Christians and by Constantine
   represents the cross with the initials of the name of Christ (the X and
   the P), thus:

   The cross was so fixed into the earth that the feet of the sulferer
   were usually about 2 feet from the ground. In or near the middle of the
   upright post there was a projection, to which he was raised by cords;
   and being previously divested of his clothing, he was first bound to
   the cross-beam, and then nailed by his hands, with strong iron spikes,
   to its extremities. There is conclusive evidence from profane history
   that the hands were pierced in this way, and that it was peculiar to
   the punishment of crucifixion, but whether the feet were nailed
   separately, or whether a single nail transfixed them both, or whether
   they were merely tied to the beam by a cord, is doubtful. In order to
   lessen the pain, it was customary to give the sufferer wine medicated
   with myrrh, etc. Our Redeemer rejected this draught, Mark 15:23,
   choosing to suffer to the full extent the pains of death. Vinegar, too,
   was a refreshing and sustaining drink, and was offered to him. Matt
   27:48. The criminal was fastened to the cross by four soldiers
   appointed for the purpose, who were allowed the apparel of the sufferer
   as the perquisite of their office. Matt 27:35.

   Over the cross was commonly placed a writing or superscription,
   indicating the offence for which the individual was put to death. It
   was called by the Romans titulus, or the title. John 19:19-22.

   Among the Romans the prisoner often remained upon the cross till his
   body fell to the earth by its own weight, but the Jews were permitted,
   in obedience to the precept of their law, Deut 21:22-23, to terminate
   the sufferings of the malefactor before sundown. This was effected in
   various ways-sometimes by setting fire to the foot of the cross, and at
   others by breaking the limbs with a hammer or piercing the body with a
   lance. John 19:31-37. The agonies of this death were extreme. Cicero
   says: ""The executioner, the covering of the head, the very name of the
   cross, should be removed afar, not only from the body, but from the
   thoughts, the eyes, the ears, of Roman citizens; for of all these
   things, not only the actual occurrence and endurance, but the very
   contingency and expectation-nay, the mention itself-is unworthy of a
   Roman citizen and a freeman."" The judges denominated it ""the utmost
   torment, the extremest punishment.""

   The extension of the limbs just after so severe a scourging, and the
   impossibility of making the slightest motion without occasioning
   suffering, the piercing of the hands and feet in the parts most
   susceptible of acute and agonizing pain, the exposure of the wounded
   and lacerated flesh to the action of the sun and air hour after hour,
   the loss of blood, and the sense of the indignity and contempt, which,
   as shown to our Saviour, was the most bitter, malicious, and unsparing
   that can be conceived,-all conspired to make it, to the very last
   degree, a death of pain. Often the strength of the malefactor lingered
   for three days, and even longer. Hence the surprise of Pilate. Mark
   15:44.

   The figure of a cross has often been represented on the banners of
   contending armies, thus:

   With the conversion of the Roman empire, the cross, from a sign of
   shame, became a sign of honor. It reminds us of the great price of our
   salvation, and points the true way to immortality and glory: ""No cross,
   no crown.""

   The cross is often used figuratively for those reproaches,
   self-denials, and sacrifices which the true followers of Christ must be
   expected to endure if they faithfully maintain their profession. Matt
   16:24.

   The classic work upon the cross and the crucifixion of Jesus is Justus
   Lipsius's (d. 1606) De Cruce, 1595. But in 1878, Herman Fulda, pastor
   near Halle, Germany, issued a work entitled Das Kreuz und die
   Kreuzigung, which maintains that Lipsius and all his followers are
   wrong. This statement he fortifies by a fresh examination of the
   sources. According to Fulda, the cross of Jesus was a post. His hands
   were nailed on either side of it; his feet, the knees being much bent,
   were fastened by a stout cord to this post, but not nailed, and they,
   together with the nailed hands, supported the body. Owing to haste, he
   deems it probable that the customary ""seat"" fastened to the cross as a
   partial support was wanting. Fulda finds in this extremely painful
   position one reason for the speedy death of Jesus, which occasioned
   Pilate's incredulity.","",1
1114,Crown,"CROWN. 2 Kgs 11:12. Anciently the crown or diadem was only a headband,
   Eze 16:12, or a ribbon or fillet, made of silk or linen, surrounding
   the head, and probably connected behind. Crowns arose probably from the
   natural custom of wearing wreaths of flowers on occasions of joy and
   festivity, or else from the custom of binding the hair to prevent its
   dishevelment by the wind. Ex 28:36-37; Ex 29:6. We find it represented
   on ancient medals. Newly married persons of both sexes wore crowns.
   Comp. Song of Solomon 3:11 with Eze 16:12. It was usually a badge of
   royalty or princely distinction. It was sometimes of pure gold, and was
   worn by kings, 2 Chr 23:11; Matt 27:29, and sometimes in battle. 2 Sam
   1:10; 2 Sam 12:30. The weight, in the last passage, denotes the value,
   and not the

   Crowns. (After Ayre.) 1. Crown of Upper Egypt. 2. Crown of Upper and
   Lower Egypt United, 3. Assyrian Crown, from Nineveh Marbles. 4. Laurel

   gravity, of the crown. Afterward the shape and size were changed, and
   costly ornaments appended to it. 2 Sam 12:30. It was worn by queens.
   Esth 2:17. It was customary for a king to wear as many crowns as he had
   kingdoms. Rev 19:12. The word is figuratively used by the sacred
   writers to denote honor, Prov 12:4, prosperity, Lam 5:16, eternal life,
   and blessedness. 1 Pet 5:4. The inscription on the crown of the high
   priest, Ex 39:30, was significant of his sacred office and functions.
   Such inscriptions have sometimes been placed on the crowns of princes
   and heroes to indicate some splendid action or service. Paul uses the
   custom of giving crowns of laurel or parsley to the victors in the
   Greek games to furnish an illustration of the difference between the
   honor of earthly distinction and that which comes from following
   Christ. In Rev 17:5 allusion seems to be made to the crown of the
   Jewish high priest, whose raiment is described as having the colors and
   ornaments of the sacred vestments. It is said that the word mystcrium
   (""mystery"") was formerly engraven on the papal crown, and was erased in
   the time of Julius III.

   The ""crown of thorns"" worn by Christ, Matt 27:29, was probably made of
   a common Arabian plant, called ??uabk??, which has ""many small and
   sharp spines, soft, round, pliant branches, leaves much resembling ivy,
   of a very deep green, as if in designed mockery of a victor's
   wreath.""-Hasselquist, quoted in Ayre: Treasury of Bible Knowledge. The

   ""Cucumbers form an important item in the summer food of the poor, and

   in form, 150 miles long, and from 50 to 60 miles broad. Venus was its
   chief goddess; hence her name Cypria. It contained two prominent
   cities, Salamis and Paphos, and 17 towns. Salamis was at the east and
   Paphos at the west end of the island. Acts 13:5. Barnabas was a native
   of Cyprus, and its people are noticed in apostolic history. Acts 4:36;
   Acts 13:4; Acts 15:39. Sergius Paulus, proconsul of Cyprus, was
   converted by Paul on his first missionary-tour, Acts 13:7 ff., and thus
   became the first Christian ruler on record.

   History.-Cyprus was colonized by the Phoenicians at a very early date.
   It was the Chittim, or Kittim, of the O.T. Num 24:24. Through Greek
   colonists it received the name of Kypros, perhaps from the plant cyprus
   (henna-Lawsonia alba. See Camphire). Copper-mining and the production
   of swords, armor, and other articles in bronze were its principal
   industries. There was also an extensive commerce. In literature, Cyprus
   boasted of very early distinction. Thothmes III

   of Egypt conquered the island. At a later period Belus, king of Tyre,
   destroyed most of its cities. Sargon made it tributary to Assyria, b.c.
   707; Apries, king of Egypt (the Pharaoh of Scripture), plundered it.
   Later, it was tributary to Darius. The Athenians and Lacedemonians
   conquered part of Cyprus from the Persians, b.c. 477. Alexander the
   Great was aided by 120 ships from this island in his siege of Tyre,
   b.c. 335. In b.c. 294 the island was a dependency of Egypt. Cato took
   possession of it for the Romans. Cicero was proconsul there, b.c. 52.
   The Byzantine emperors and the Arabs successively held sway. Cyprus was
   a frequent halting place of the Crusaders. Richard I, of England
   captured it in A.D. 1191, and sold it to the Knights Templars. Later,
   the Genoese and Venetians held the island. The Turks dispossessed the
   Venetians a.d. 1570, and have retained their mastery for more than 300
   years. The control of Cyprus was secured in 1878 by the English
   government as a naval station and base of operation for the protection
   of Asiatic Turkey and the Indian government. The recent excavations and
   discoveries of General Cesnola have brought to light a vast number of
   antiquities and works of art of Phoenician, Egyptian, Greek, and
   specific Cypriotic characters, which are deposited in the Metropolitan
   Museum of New York. See Cesnola: Cyprus, its Ancient Cities, Tombs, and

   Grecian city, founded about b.c. 631. Under Alexander the Great the
   Jews were about one-fourth of the population, and were granted
   citizenship on the same terms as Greeks. At Alexander's death it was
   attached to Egypt; became a Roman province in b.c. 75; Simon, who bore

   manifestly related to Astarte. There were temples of Dagon at Gaza,

1151,Damascus,"DAMAS'CUS, the most ancient and famous city of Syria, 133 miles
   north-east of Jerusalem, at the base of Anti-Lebanon mountains. It is
   on a fertile plain 30 miles in diameter, with mountains on three sides.
   The plain is well watered by the Barada, the Chrysorrhoas (or ""Golden
   Stream"") of the Greeks, the Abana of Scripture; and El A'waj (""the
   crooked""), the Pharpar of Scripture. 2 Kgs 5:12. These streams flow
   into meadow-lakes 18 miles east of the city. Damascus lies 2260 feet
   above the sealevel. The climate is delightful; frost is not uncommon in
   winter, but fireplaces are unknown; in summer the thermometer marks 100
   F to 104 F but the nights are cool and the dews heavy; yet the people
   sleep on the flat roofs of their houses. Damascus is called by the
   Arabs ""the Eye of the Desert"" and the ""Pearl

   of the East."" It is to the Mohammedan the earthly reflection of
   paradise. The chief cause of its beauty and fertility is the abundance
   of water, which calls forth a most luxuriant vegetation round about the
   city, and makes it a blooming oasis in the midst of a vast desert.

   History. -Damascus is called the oldest city in the world; said by
   Josephus to have been founded by Uz, a grandson of Shem; Abraham
   visited it, Gen 14:15; Gen 15:2; it was conquered by David, 2 Sam
   8:5-6; was allied with Israel and against Israel, 1 Kgs 15:18, Ruth
   4:20; 2 Chr 16:3; was taken by Tiglath-pileser;

   Wall of Damascus.(From, Conybeare and Howson's ""St. Paul."")

   denounced by Jeremiah. Jer 49:27; and afterward seldom noticed in O.T.
   history. It was surrendered to Alexander the Great after the battle of
   Issus, b.c. 333. In the N.T. it is noticed as the place of the scene of
   Paul's conversion, Acts 9:1-25; later it became the residence of a
   Christian bishop; was conquered by the Arabs, a.d. 635; attacked by the
   Crusaders, A.D. 1126: several times besieged; was taken by the Mongols,
   1260; plundered by the Tartars, 1300; attacked by Timour, 1399, to whom
   it paid a million pieces of gold; became A provincial capital of the
   Turkish empire, 1516; and is now the residence of a Turkish governor.
   It is the hot-bed of Mohammedan fanaticism. In 1860, 6000 Christians
   were massacred by the Moslems in cold blood, in the city and adjoining
   districts.

   Present Condition. -Though twelve times pillaged and burned, it now
   extends on both sides of the Barada, and has a population of from
   110,000 to 150,000. The most remarkable building is the Great Mosque,
   which was once a Byzantine church dedicated to John the Baptist. The
   principal street, known as Sultany, or Queen's street, runs in nearly a
   straight line from east to west, and is supposed to be the same as the
   street called ""Straight"" in Acts 9:11. The traditional sites of the
   houses of Naaman and Ananias and the place in the wall where Paul was
   let down in a basket are still pointed out. No less than four places
   near the city have been claimed as the scene of Paul's conversion.

   The Presbyterian Church of Ireland maintains a Protestant mission
   there, which has several substantial buildings and labors among the
   Greeks and the Jews. There is also an Episcopal mission and chapel in
   Damascus.","",1
1152,Damnation,"DAMNA'TION. This term, in common use, denotes the endless perdition of
   the ungodly. Matt 23:3; Mark 3:29; John 5:28-29; 2 Pet 2:3. But when
   the Bible was translated the word was used where ""condemnation"" or
   ""judgment"" would more properly express the sense, so that, while
   generally applying to the eternal state of the soul, it is sometimes to
   be taken in its milder meaning. Ignorance of this fact has led to
   deplorable consequences. Saints have been made despondent and sinners
   driven to despair. 1 Cor 11:29 ought to be translated ""eateth and
   drinketh judgment to himself."" So in Rom 13:2 and 1 Sam 14:23.

   DAN (judge), the fifth son of Jacob, and the first of Bilhah, Rachel's
   maid. Gen 30:6. Nothing is known personally of the patriarch. The
   prediction uttered by Jacob respecting him, Gen 49:16-17, is variously
   interpreted. It is probable that the elevation of his tribe to an equal
   rank with the others, notwithstanding that he was born of a concubine,
   was foretold in v. Ex 17:16, and the residue of the prediction may
   allude to the subtle and crafty disposition of his descendants. Indeed,
   we know that Samson, who was among the most noted of them, was
   remarkably successful in stratagem, Jud 14-15; and perhaps the same
   trait was characteristic of their tribe. Jud 18:26-27.

   It is noticeable that the tribe of Dan is omitted from the numbering in
   Rev 7. Because of this, and because Dan first introduced idolatry into
   Israel, Jud 18, many of the fathers maintained that Antichrist would
   come from Dan.","",1
1153,Dan,"DAN.
    1. The territory in Canaan allotted to Dan was on the sea-coast, west
       of Benjamin and between Ephraim and Judah. It embraced a broad
       plain, 14 miles long, near the sea. The Amorites kept them from the
       plain and forced them into the mountains. Hence they had another
       portion granted them, near Mount Hermon, Jud 18, where they set up
       a graven image stolen from Micah.
    2. Dan, City of, the chief city of the northern district held by this
       tribe. Jud 20:1. It was originally called Laish, Jud 18:29; noted
       for idolatry, Jud 18:30; now called Tel-el-Kady, or ""mound of the
       judge,"" 3 miles from Banias, north of the waters of Merom.
    3. The Dan of Eze 27:19 is possibly the same as No. 2, but some
       identify it with Dedar, others with Aden, in Arabia.","",1
1154,Dance,"DANCE. The Jewish dances were generally expressions of joy and
   gratitude, sometimes in honor of a conqueror, Jud 11:34; 1 Sam 18:6-7,
   and sometimes on domestic occasions. Jer 31:4, 2 Kgs 11:13; Luke 15:25.
   The dance was also introduced into the religious service, and the
   timbrel (tambourine) was employed to direct it. Some individual led,
   and the rest followed with measured steps and devotional songs. Thus,
   David and Miriam led such a band. 2 Sam 6:14; Ex 15:20. Individuals
   often expressed feelings of joy in the same way. Luke 6:23; Acts 3:8.

   Dancing was practised from a very early period as a natural exercise
   and amusement. Job 21:11; Mark 6:22. But the mingling of males and
   females which is so common in modern dances was unknown to the Jews.
   Indeed, the dancing was mostly done by the women alone, as is still the
   case in Egypt.

   A Hebrew word, mahhol, which occurs in some passages -e.g. Ps 150:4-and
   is rendered ""dance"" in our version, is supposed by some scholars to
   mean a musical instrument.","",1
1155,Daniel,"DANIEL (God is my judge). 1. One of the four greater prophets. He was
   of noble, perhaps of royal, descent, and probably born at Jerusalem.
   Dan 1:3; Dan 9:24; comp. Josephus's Antiq. In his early youth he was
   carried captive by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon, together with three other
   Hebrew youths of rank, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, b.c. 604. He was
   there instructed in the language and arts of the Chaldaeans, and, with
   his three companions, trained for the royal service in the palace. Dan
   1:1-4. The prince of the eunuchs changed all their names, calling them
   respectively Belteshazzar (i.e. ""prince of Bel""), Shadrach, Meshach,
   and Abednego. These four refused to eat of the king's meat and to drink
   his wine, but chose ""pulse and water."" Notwithstanding this diet, they
   were in better condition than the heathen courtiers.

   After three years' training, God gave Daniel an opportunity to display
   his learning and wisdom. He interpreted a dream which Nebuchadnezzar
   had forgotten. Dan 2. In reward, he was made ""ruler over the whole
   province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men
   of Babylon,"" and in this position so distinguished himself that he won
   great fame and was mentioned as a model man even by his contemporaries.
   Eze 14:14, Ruth 4:20; 1 Sam 28:3. On another occasion he faithfully
   explained to his monarch the intention of God to punish him for his
   pride. Dan 4. For Belshazzar, a grandson and successor of
   Nebuchadnezzar, he performed a similar service, reading the handwriting
   upon the wall, Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin. Dan 5.

   Under Darius the Mede, Daniel was made the first of the ""three
   presidents "" of the empire. His enemies obtained a command from Darius
   forbidding all prayer save unto the king for 30 days. But Daniel did
   not stop praying; and this fact being discovered, he was cast into the
   den of lions, which was the punishment for a violation of the king's
   order. But God delivered him, and he was kept in his office. In the
   reign of Cyrus he likewise prospered, but seems to have left Babylon,
   as his latest recorded vision, Dan 10:1,Ex 6:4, was by the Hiddekel, in
   the third year of Cyrus, b.c. 534. When he died, and where, are
   uncertain. His reputed tomb is shown at Susa, on the Tigris.

   Daniel at the court of Babylon resembles Joseph at the court of
   Pharaoh. Both were involuntary exiles from their country and people;
   both were great statesmen; both maintained the purity of their religion
   and their personal character, though surrounded by idolatry and
   corruption; both rose by their wisdom and integrity from slavery to the
   highest dignity in a heathen empire; both are shining examples of
   loyalty to God and to virtue.
    1. Daniel is the name of two. or perhaps three, other persons
       mentioned in the Bible.

   (a) The second son of David by Abigail the Carmelitess. 1 Chr 3:1. He
   is, however, called Chileab in 2 Sam 3:3.

   (b) A priest of the family of Ithamar, mentioned, Ezr 8:2, as having
   returned with Ezra. He is probably again spoken of in Neh 10:6 among
   those who sealed the covenant drawn up by Nehemiah, b.c. 445.

   DANIEL, BOOK OF. It consists of two distinct parts.
    1. Historical, chs. Dan 1-6, containing the interesting narrative
       given in the preceding section, and with it an account of the
       attempted burning of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego in a fiery
       furnace because they would not worship the golden image which
       Nebuchadnezzar set up on the plain of Dura.
    2. Apocalyptic, chs. Dan 1:7-12, or the record of Daniel's visions.
       Ch.Dan 1:1 contains the introduction,- chs. Dan 1:2-6 present a
       general view of the progressive history of the powers of the world,
       and of the principles of the divine government, as seen in events
       in the life of Daniel; and chs. Dan 1:7-12, the prophecy of the
       future of the people of God. The book is written in prose, but not
       in the same language throughout. The introduction, chs. Dan
       1:1-2:4, first clause, is written in Hebrew, but from the second
       clause of the fourth verse of the second chapter to the end of ch.
       7 it is in Aramaic, called Syriac in that verse. From the beginning
       of ch. 8 to the end, in which part the visions are related in the
       first person, the language is Hebrew.

   The interpretation of Daniel requires profound knowledge of ancient
   history. The book is, in fact, a sort of religious philosophy of
   history. Its fundamental idea is that all the kingdoms of the world,
   which pass away, are ruled and overruled by divine Providence for the
   kingdom of Christ, which will last for ever. The book of Daniel
   occupies in the O.T. the same position which the Revelation of John
   occupies in the New. It views the kingdom of God in its contact and
   conflicts with the empires of the world, and looks forward to the
   universal reign of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final
   judgment. The empires of the world appear first in Nebuchadnezzar's
   dream, ch. Lev 10:2, under the figure of a colossal image with a head
   of gold, a breast and arms of silver, a belly of brass, and legs and
   feet of iron and clay. These represent respectively (according to the
   usual orthodox interpretation) the Babylonian, the Medo-Persian, the
   Macedo-Greek, and the Roman empires; they are overthrown at last by a
   stone cut out of the mountain without hands and becoming a great
   mountain, which represents the reign of the Messiah. The indestructible
   rock of God's own workmanship breaks to pieces the metal colossus of
   man's hand. The same succession of monarchies is presented in the
   seventh chapter, under the form of a vision of four beasts seen by the
   prophet himself. The fourth beast has ten horns, denoting ten kingdoms,
   growing out of it, and a little horn (Song of Solomon 7:8, Jud 6:24)
   springing up among the four fractured horns of the Greek empire.
   Interpreters agree as to the first empire, which must be Babylonia, but
   differ as to the other three. Some combine the Medes and Persians in
   one empire; others divide them, and regard the Greeks (Alexander the
   Great and his successors) as representing the fourth empire, and refer
   the ""little horn"" to Antiochus Epiphanes. Still others give the
   prophecy of Daniel a more comprehensive sweep over all the
   world-empires before and after Christ, as preparing the way for the
   ultimate and everlasting reign of Christ. This prophecy of Christ, the
   most important in the book, is constantly fulfilling before our eyes,
   and cannot be set aside by any negative criticism.

   The book of Daniel has been much attacked, but also successfully
   vindicated by biblical scholars. In the second part Daniel speaks in
   the first person as the receiver of the divine revelations recorded
   therein, so that the only alternative here is between truth and fraud.
   The very fact that two languages are used renders it extremely unlikely
   that it should have been forged or written in any later period, but to
   Daniel, familiar as he was with both Hebrew and Aramaic, it was
   natural. The book displays familiar acquaintance with Babylonian life
   and royal manners, and suits throughout the period of the Babylonian
   exile and the peculiar position of Daniel at the Babylonian court. The
   genuineness is sanctioned by the highest authority -that of Christ,
   Matt 24:15, from which there is no appeal for believers.

   The attacks upon the book have been in three lines: (1) Its
   extraordinary events -the golden image, the burning fiery furnace, the
   dreams, the lions' den, etc.; (2) its minute prophecies; (3) its
   foreign (Greek) words; (4) its narrative. To these objections it is
   sufficient to reply:(1) The characteristics of Babylon, the manners and
   customs of the East, amply justify the language and prove that the book
   is genuinely Oriental and Babylonian. (2) The peculiar position of
   Daniel required an exceptional and startling character for his
   revelations; his prophecies have been in great part fulfilled. (3) The
   Greek words are only four in number, and are the names of musical
   instruments which may have been imported from Greece as early as b.c.
   600. (4) Its historical difficulties. Belshazzar is represented as the
   last king of Babylon, while the authority there known gave Nabonnedus
   as the last king. This difficulty was solved by Sir Henry Rawlinson's
   decipherment of a cylinder among the ruins of Ur in Chaldaea in 1854.
   Nabonnedus had his eldest son, Belshazzar, as co-regent, and therefore
   it might well be that while he met the Persians in the field his son
   ruled in the capital. Thus is explained how Daniel was made the third
   ruler in the kingdom. Dan 5:16, 1 Chr 2:29.

   Apocryphal Additions to Daniel. -These exist in the Greek version, and
   are: The Song of the Three Holy Children, the History of Susanna, and
   the Story of Bel and the Dragon. They passed into the Vulgate, and so
   into modern translations. They embody popular traditions, but never
   formed part of the Hebrew Bible.
    1. The Song of the Three Holy Children purports to be the triumphal
       song of the three confessors in the furnace, Dan 3:23, in praise of
       their miraculous deliverance. The chief part has been used as a
       hymn (Benedicite) in the Christian Church since the fourth century.
    2. The History of Susanna, who was cleared from a charge of adultery

   time about 62 years old. The best identification is that which makes
   him Astyages, the last king of the Medes. ""Only one year of the reign
   of Darius is mentioned, Dan 9:1; Dan 11:1; and if, as seems probable,
   Darius (Astyages) occupied the throne of Babylon as supreme sovereign,
   with Nerigalsarasser as vassal-prince, after the murder of
   Evil-merodaeh (Belshazzar), b.c. 559, one year only remains for this
   Median supremacy before its overthrow by Cyrus, b.c. 558, in exact
   accordance with the notices in Daniel."" Under him Daniel was advanced
   to the highest dignity, which exposed him to the malice of enemies and
   led to his being cast into the den of lions, but by a miracle he
   escaped injury. See Daniel.

       Achmetha or Ecbatana, the capital of Cyrus, a decree of that king
       concerning the temple in Jerusalem. This he confirmed, and the
       temple was finished in 4 years, b.c. 516. Ezr 6:15. It may,
       however, have been used before it was entirely completed, as is
       inferred from Zech 7:2-3.
    2. Darius the Persian, mentioned in Neh 12:22, is generally identified
       with Darius Codomannus, the antagonist of Alexander the Great, who
       ascended the throne b.c. 336, and reigned until b.c. 330. He was
       the last Persian monarch, and was killed by his own generals.
       Alexander defeated him, and thus the prophecy of Daniel, ch. Dan 8,
       was fulfilled.

1166,David,"DA'VID (beloved), the youngest of the eight sons of Jesse, of the tribe
   of Judah, was born in Bethlehem, b.c. 1085, and was both in his
   prophetical and regal character an eminent type of the Messiah. 1 Sam
   16:13. While he was employed as a shepherd in his father's fields God
   sent Samuel to Bethlehem, on the occasion of the annual sacrificial
   feast, with instructions to anoint David as king of Israel in the place
   of Saul, who had incurred the divine displeasure, and was therefore to
   be deposed. Dean Stanley thus describes David's appearance and physique
   as he stood before Samuel: ""He was short of stature, had red hair and
   bright eyes. He was remarkable for the grace of his figure and
   countenance, well made, and of immense strength and agility. In
   swiftness and activity he could only be compared to a wild gazelle,
   with feet like harts' feet, with arms strong enough to break a bow of
   steel. Ps 18:33-34, ""-History of the Jewish Church, 2d series, Lect.
   22. Probably neither David nor any one else understood the real meaning
   of this anointing. At all events, David went back to the shepherd-life.
   We next hear of him as chosen by Saul, upon the suggestion of one of
   the bodyguard, to play upon a harp, and thus soothe the troubled spirit
   of the king. In this he was eminently successful. Saul made him one of
   his armor-bearers, and requested permission of Jesse to allow him to
   remain at his court. 1 Sam 16:21-23. But it seems that David after a
   time returned home. It was then perhaps that his adventure with the
   lion and the bear took place. After an interval of uncertain length
   -Josephus says ""after a few years""-David had his famous fight with
   Goliath. But he had so altered that Saul did not recognize in the grown
   man flushed by triumph the lad who had played the harp in his hours of
   mental distress; hence his question of Abner -""Whose son is this
   youth?""-was natural. 1 Sam 17:55. The superiority in military glory
   which the women gave David excited the jealousy of the king, and so,
   although David was made a chieftain, lived at court, and enjoyed the
   friendship of the king's son, yet he was constantly exposed to the
   wrath of Saul.

   Agreeably to the terms of the king's promise to him who slew the giant,
   David became the king's son-in-law, marrying Michal, whom he loved, but
   only on condition that he slew a hundred Philistines-an exaction made
   in hope that the attempt would end fatally. But David and his men slew
   two hundred. David found his position full of danger. His very presence
   seemed to arouse the envy of Saul, so that the latter determined to
   kill him, and several times cast his javelin at him as he stood playing
   before him. By a stratagem Michal saved David's life and enabled him to
   flee to Samuel at Ramah. 1 Sam 19:13, 1 Sam 30:18. David then became
   convinced that a further residence at court was impossible, and
   accordingly an affecting parting with Jonathan took place, 1 Sam 20,
   and David became a fugitive from the hand of Saul. Armed with the sword
   of Goliath and anointed with the sacred oil, the future king sought a
   home among the Philistines. But his fame had preceded him, and his
   assumed madness scarcely saved him. 1 Sam 21. Therefore he went to the
   cave of Adullam and gathered gradually a motley crowd, composed of
   insolvent debtors and malcontents. 1 Sam 22:1-2. But David proved his
   fitness to rule a kingdom by controlling these men and bringing them to
   accede to his wishes.

   The history of David's life for the next few years is filled with the
   details of alternate defeats and victories, of his flight, of his
   magnanimous refusal to lay hands on the Lord's anointed, 1 Sam 24:16,
   of his residence among neighboring tribes, of the episode of Abigail, 1
   Sam 25, and finally of the battle of Gilboa, in which Jonathan fell and
   Saul slew himself, unable to bear defeat. 1 Sam 31. The lament which he
   then composed is one of the noblest odes of friendship, and a monument
   of his generosity to a fallen foe and of devotion to a fallen friend. 2
   Sam 1:19-27.

   Then David, by divine direction, removed to Hebron, where the chief men
   of Judah met him and offered him the government of their tribe, which
   he accepted. Accordingly, he was anointed for the second time. 2 Sam
   2:4. In Hebron, as king of Judah, he reigned seven years and a half.
   During this time Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, by means of the skilful
   general Abner, maintained a decreasing semblance of authority over
   Israel. But at length he and Abner were killed, and thus the way
   prepared for the execution of God's plan to set David on the throne of
   united Israel.

   David was solemnly anointed for the third time. 2 Sam 5:3. Soon after
   he assumed the government he obtained possession of Jerusalem, reduced
   the fortress which the Jebusites had maintained, and established the
   seat of his government there. Under his wise and liberal policy the
   place was greatly enlarged; magnificent edifices rose up on every side,
   fortifications were erected, and the ark, which had been before without
   a fixed abode, was brought into the new city with religious ceremonies
   peculiarly joyful and solemn. 2 Sam 6:12-19. Thenceforward, Jerusalem
   became the capital of the kingdom, the residence of the royal family,
   and, more than all, the city of God. Ps 48:2; Matt 6:35. To it the
   tribes repaired from every quarter of the land to celebrate their
   annual festivals, and its growth in population, wealth, and splendor
   was very rapid.

   David now formed the design of building a magnificent temple for the
   worship of Jehovah, to take the place of the tabernacle, which was but
   a temporary and movable structure. He was informed, however, by God's
   direction, that this service would be reserved for his son Solomon. 2
   Sam 7.

   After several contests with the nations that bordered on Israel, in
   which David was uniformly victorious, there broke out a war with the
   Ammonites (see Ammonites), during the progress of which David fell into
   those most aggravated sins of murder and adultery which brought
   disgrace and distress on his family and government and involved him in
   trouble during the remnant of his days. 2 Sam 12:9. His domestic peace
   was destroyed by the outrage committed upon Tamar by Amnon, revenged,
   ""after two full years,"" by Absalom, who slew Amnon at a feast. 2 Sam
   13:14, 1 Chr 2:29. This murder occasioned Absalom's flight to his
   father-in-law's court at Geshur. Being recalled, he started a rebellion
   which compelled the king to flee from his capital and exile himself to
   avoid being cut off by a parricidal hand. 2 Sam 15-18. The

   Tomb of David. (After a Photograph by Good.)

   death of Absalom, though it brought relief to the kingdom, inflicted a
   deep wound on the father's heart. The insurrection under Sheba and the
   murder of Amasa by Joab followed in quick succession. And to close the
   melancholy catalogue was the terrible judgment which he brought upon
   himself and the nation by numbering the people for some purpose which
   was sinful in the sight of God, though not explained to us. 2 Sam 24.

   David was now 70 years old, and had reigned seven and a half years over
   the tribe of Judah and thirty three over the whole kingdom of Israel.
   Just before his death his son Adonijah made a bold attempt to usurp the
   throne,- and to secure the kingdom against any pretender, David
   resigned the crown to Solomon, put into his hands the plan and model of
   the temple and the treasure accumulated for it, summoned the
   influential men of the nation, and delivered his farewell address. He
   died b.c. 1015, and was buried in the ""city of David."" 1 Kgs 2:10. His
   tomb became the sepulchre of subsequent kings, and one of the sacred
   places of the kingdom. It is pointed out on Mount Zion, at Jerusalem,
   outside the city wall. See cut, above. David was a type of Christ. They
   both inherited their kingdoms after suffering. And David, as the ruler
   over temporal Israel, was a forerunner of the Son of David, who was to
   reign over the spiritual Israel for ever. Matt 1:1; Matt 9:27; Matt
   12:23, etc.

   When David is spoken of as a man after God's ""own heart,"" 1 Sam 13:14;
   Acts 13:22, reference is obviously intended to his general character
   and conduct, and not to every particular instance of it. As he was
   human, he was imperfect; and when he sinned, God punished him, and that
   with great severity. But he was remarkable for his devotion to God's
   service, and he kept himself from idols. He established the government
   of Israel, and extended its dominions to the full extent of the promise
   to Abraham, and left a compact and united empire, stretching from Egypt
   to Lebanon, and from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean.

   The life and character of David shine in his poetry- the life of
   action, adventure, war; the character of manly strength and womanly
   tenderness. Thus his Psalms supply biographical material. By means of
   them his heart is read. The man who could kill a giant is found to have
   a delicate appreciation of friendship. He whose passion led him into
   sin, whose hate into words of cursing, was able to mourn with deepest
   humility and bless with heartiest assent. It is to the Psalms of David,
   albeit he did not write the entire collection, that the Church of God
   has appealed for comfort in adversity and sanctification in prosperity.
   In regard to them Canon Perowne truthfully and eloquently says: ""The
   very excellence of these Psalms is their universality. They spring from
   the deep fountains of the human heart, and God, in his providence and
   by his Spirit, has so ordered it that they should be for his Church an
   everlasting heritage. Hence they express the sorrows, the joys, the
   aspirations, the struggles, the victories, not of one man, but of all.
   And if we ask. How comes this to pass? the answer is not far to seek.
   One object is ever before the eyes and the heart of the Psalmist. All
   enemies, all distresses, all persecutions, all sins, are seen in the
   light of God. It is to him that the cry goes up; it is to him that the
   heart is laid bare; it is to him that the thanksgiving is uttered. This
   it is which makes them so true, so precious, so universal. No surer
   proof of their inspiration can be given than this-that they are not of
   an age, but for all time; that the ripest Christian can use them in the
   fulness of his Christian manhood, though the words are the words of one
   who lived centuries before the coming of Christ in the flesh.""-The
   Psalms, 3d ed., vol. i. p. 21.

1167,Day,"DAY. The natural day consists of 24 hours, or one revolution of the
   earth upon its axis. The artificial day is the time during which the
   sun is above the horizon. The civil day is reckoned differently by
   different nations-some from sunrise to sunrise; others from sunset to
   sunset; others still from noon to noon, or from midnight to midnight.
   The Jewish day was reckoned from evening to evening, adopted, as some
   think, from Gen 1:5, or, as others with more probability hold, from the
   ""use of the lunar calendar in regulating days of religious observance.""
   Lev 23:32. Their Sabbath, or seventh day, which was the only day
   named-the others were numbered merely-began on what we call Friday, at
   sunset, and ended on what we call Saturday, at sunset. Ex 12:18. This
   mode of reckoning days was not uncommon in other Eastern nations. The
   day was originally divided into morning, noon, and night. Ps 55:17. But
   besides, the Jews distinguished six unequal parts, which were again
   subdivided. 1. Dawn, subdivided into gray dawn and rosy dawn. 2.
   Sunrise. Some supposed that the Hebrews, prior to leaving Egypt, began
   the day at that time, but discontinued it by divine command, and began
   at even in order to be different from those nations which worshipped
   the rising sun. 3. The heat of the day, about nine o'clock. 1 Sam
   11:11; Neh 7:3, etc. 4. The two noons. Gen 43:16; Deut 28:29. 5. The
   cool (lit. wind) of the day, before sunset. Gen 3:8. 6. Evening. In Ex
   12:6; Ex 30:8, margins, occurs the phrase ""between the two evenings,""
   which probably is correctly taken to mean ""between the beginning and
   end of sunset.""

   The mention of hours in the Bible dates from the Captivity, Dan 3:6,
   and it is therefore reasonably presumed that this division of time is
   of Babylonish origin. Before the Captivity the Jews divided the night
   into three watches-from sunset to midnight, from midnight to cock-crow,
   Jud 7:19; from cock-crow to sunrise. Ex 14:24. In the N.T. mention is
   made of four watches, because the Greek and Roman division was then
   adopted. In our Lord's time the division of the day into 12 hours was
   common. John 11:9. The word ""day"" is used of a festal day, Hos 7:5; a
   birthday. Job 3:1; a day of ruin, Hos 1:11; Job 18:20; the
   judgment-day, Joel 1:15; 1 Thess 5:2; Acts 17:31; and the kingdom of
   Christ. John 8:56; Rom 13:12. It is also often used to denote an
   indefinite time. Gen 2:4; Isa 22:5. The term ""three days and three
   nights,"" in Matt 12:40, denotes the same space of time as ""three days.""
   Matt 27:63-64.

   Day's Journey, a distance mentioned Gen 31:23; Ex 3:18, etc. It is
   quite evident that this phrase does not mean any particular distance,
   but rather the space travelled during one day, and this would of course
   vary with the circumstances of the traveller. But unless there is
   special reason for believing the contrary, we may interpret it as
   meaning a stretch of 25 to 30 miles, since this is the usual length of
   a day's journey in the East, on camel or horseback, performed in 6 to 8
   hours. See also Sabbath Day's Journey.

1171,Deacon,"DEA'CON (servant). This name, as a title of office, has been applied to
   the ""seven men of honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom,""
   who were appointed over the business of serving tables, in order that
   the apostles might be at liberty to give themselves continually to
   prayer and the ministry of the word. They were set apart by prayer and
   the laying on of the apostles' hands. Acts 6:1-6. Very likely these
   seven men held a higher position than those afterward appointed, as, in
   addition to routine and more or less servile duties, they preached and
   did the work of evangelists; e.g. Stephen and Philip. The idea that a
   man must be a deacon before he can be an elder or bishop is not found
   in the N.T. The qualifications and duties of deacons are particularly
   set forth in Acts 6:1-6 and 1 Tim 3:8-12","",1
1172,Deaconess,"DEA'CONESS. Such was Phoebe, and in all probability Tryphena, Tryphosa,
   and Persis occupied the same office in the church in Rome. Rom 16:1,
   Jud 4:12. It is therefore probable that there was in the different
   churches an order of pious women employed in attending upon those of
   their own sex in some of the same offices and duties which the deacons
   performed for their brethren. Among these we reckon the care of the
   sick, of the poor and the widows, the education of orphans, attention
   to strangers, the practice of hospitality, comp. 1 Tim 5:10, and the
   assistance needed at the baptism of females. The question whether the
   ""widows"" in 1 Tim 5:9-16 are proper deaconesses may be answered in the
   affirmative, because the word translated ""to take into the number"" or
   ""to enroll"" applies not to widows in general, but to the deaconesses,
   for the following reasons:
    1. If understood of any insertion merely in the list of those
       supported from the congregational fund, it implies an injustice to
       widows under 60 years old or to those twice married, who might
       easily be even more destitute.
    2. The opposite interpretation conflicts with the context, for Paul
       advises, in V. 2 Kgs 22:14, the younger widows to remarry; but this
       would be to cut them off from all help in case they were widows
       again.
    3. This interpretation leaves it inexplicable why a special vow was
       required of these widows, v. Jud 4:12.
    4. But by understanding the word to apply, not to widows in general,
       but to those who were specially elected and ordained to the
       particular office of deaconess, all these objections vanish.","",1
1173,Dead,"DEAD, DEATH. Death is the destruction or extinction of life. By the
   transgression of God's commandment our first parents became liable to
   death. The threatening was, ""In the day that thou eatest thereof thou
   shalt surely die."" Gen 2:17 (comp. Rom 5:12-14; 1 Cor 15:21-22; Heb
   9:27). This expression does not mean to define the time of actual
   dissolution, but rather to denote an inevitable liability or exposure
   to death, which, in that day and by that act, they should surely incur.

   The sacred writers speak of a death which affects the body only. Gen
   25:11; of another, which describes the condition of the soul under the
   power of sin, Eph 2:1; and a third, which denotes the everlasting
   perdition of the wicked. James 5:20. In each of these senses our divine
   Redeemer may be regarded as having virtually destroyed death and
   delivered them who, through fear of death, were all their lifetime
   subject to bondage. Heb 2:14-15. To avail ourselves, however, of the

   read ""a woman of Lapidoth""), and had her judgment-seat under a palm
   tree, which from this circumstance, and from the rarity of the tree, is
   spoken of as ""the [well-known] palm tree of Deborah."" Jud 4:5. Israel
   was suffering at that time a most oppressive bondage under Jabin, a
   Canaanitish king, to which it was doomed in consequence of its sin.
   Deborah, by divine direction, called upon Barak, who had probably
   signalized himself in some way, and commanded him to station himself
   upon Mount Tabor with a prescribed number of men, and she would see to
   it that Sisera, the commander of the tyrant's army, should be there,
   and should fall into Barak's hands. Barak engaged to undertake the
   enterprise if Deborah would accompany him. To this she consented,
   prophesying, however, that if she went the honor of the victory would
   be hers and not his, and that Sisera would be regarded as having fallen
   by the hands of a woman. Jud 4:9. The two armies met, and the event was
   as Deborah predicted. Sisera fled, and died by the hand of Jael; his
   army was cut off and every man slain. Jud 4:21.

   The triumphal song composed or dictated by Deborah on that occasion is
   regarded as one of the finest specimens of Oriental poetry. Jud 5. We
   give a few verses from a revised version:


   ""Lord, when thou wentest forth out of

   Seir,

   When thou marchedst out of the field of

   Edom,

   The earth trembled, the heavens also

   dropped,

   Yea, the clouds dropped water.

   The mountains flowed down at the presence

   of the Lord,

   Even that Sinai at the presence of the Lord

   the God of Israel.

   * * * * * * * *

   The kings came, they fought;

   Then fought the kings of Canaan

   In Taanach by the waters of Megiddo;

   They took no gain of silver.

   They fought from heaven;

   The stars from their courses fought against

   Sisera.

   The river Kishon swept them away.

   That ancient river, the river Kishon.

   March on, my soul, with strength.""
